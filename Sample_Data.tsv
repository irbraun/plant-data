High levels of free branched-chain amino acids in mature seeds and leaves subjected to prolonged darkness, early senescence in prolonged darkness. About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature. . Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype. . bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems had a decreased ratio of adaxialized vascular phenotypes compared with kan1 kan2 stems. Similar to what was observed in petioles, 6.7% of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems exhibited an abaxialized phenotype of xylem surrounded by phloem, while others (13.3%) had both types of vasculature in a single stem. Similar to kan1 kan2 double mutant.  However, the ovules have a novel phenotype, forming a single amorphous structure in place of both integuments. All kan1 kan2 stem vascular bundles displayed phloem surrounded by xylem, indicating adaxialized polarity. Cotyledons are narrow, cup-shaped and point upward. Leaves are narrow, dark green and develop ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial side only.  Four to six stipules, rather than two, develop at the base of each leaf, surrounding its entire circumference.  Stems fail to elongate upon flowering.  Floral organ morphology is highly abnormal.  Mature ovules have reduced outer integuments. Aberrant positioning of cell types, primarily along the adaxial/abaxial lateral organ axis. Double mutant plants have narrow leaves and developed ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina. . External structures of the carpel are largely absent.  Ovules arise from a surface or column of tissue at the center of the flower. The inner integuments of these ovules are normal but the asymmetrical outer integument is now a nearly symmetrical and relatively amorphous collar of tissue. The vasculature in more than half (55.9%) of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles exhibited a pattern of phloem surrounded by xylem, representing an adaxialized phenotype. However, very surprisingly, 17.6% of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles had abaxialized vasculature or a mixture of adaxialized and abaxialized vasculature. Radialized leaf like organs form on the hypocotyl.

Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles. However, rapid-type anion channel current activity was not affected, consistent with the partial stomatal closing response in double mutants via a proposed branched signaling network. Imposed Ca(2+) oscillation experiments revealed that Ca(2+)-reactive stomatal closure was reduced in CDPK double mutant plants.

Plants appear slightly bleached. The ultrastructure of the plastids is conspicuously different to wild type plastids. Most evident is the structure of the thylakoids, which are reduced and the grana are unorganized compared to the wild type situation. The overall architecture of mutant homozygous plants is slightly altered compared to wild type. Roots of 6 day-old seedlings were 35% shorter on average. The main macroscopic effect of the mutation is that mutant plants produce a large amount of aborted seeds. Only about 60% of the mature seeds contain phenotypically normal, viable embryos. Up to 30% of the seeds are aborted, dark and shrunken, and do not germinate. Most of these aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the globular stage as well as ball/oblong-shaped embryos (ca. 75%). The morphogenesis of these embryos was blocked before initiation of cotyledon growth and establishment of bilateral symmetry. The other aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the torpedo or bent cotyledon stage with abnormal- shaped, thickened hypocotyls and underdeveloped cotyledons (ca. 25%). About 10% of all seeds are narrow, containing undersized, tenuous embryos which are not viable.		TAIR

In addition, higher levels of GFP-DREB2A protein are observed in drip1-1 mutants than in wild type seedlings transformed with the same construct. drip1-1 drip1-2 double mutants are developmentally delayed and bolt, flower, and set seed later than wild type plants. However, their overall size can exceed that of wild type plants if they receive adequate water. The transcript profile of these mutants differs from wild type under normal conditions, and in response to dehydration stress. Levels of numerous stress-inducible transcripts are increased in the double mutant. In addition, the double mutants appear to be more tolerant to dehydration stress than wild type plants, based on ion leakage assays and recovery after dehydration stress experiments.		TAIR
