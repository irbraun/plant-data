The data needs to be organized and also restructured into a standard format that will allow it to be easily combined with datasets from other resources.

    "There are several columns that contain information about gene names and accessions. We need to know what type of information is in each in order to know which should be retained or parsed to form the desired cleaned dataset. We are interested in both gene names that should map to a specific accession (like cms-54257) as well as gene names that are enzyme descriptions (like Ubiquitin-Specific Protease) that could map to more than one gene in a particular species. Each type of information is valuable, but needs to be differentiated so that when comparing whether two rows are specifying the same gene, this is not confused with specifying two different genes that have the same function.\n",

If a second symbol for that same gene is mentioned in the same column, the second symbol might be enclosed in parentheses. The synonynms for the gene symbols are similarly sometimes enclosed in square brackets, and are typically separated by commas in cases where more than one are mentioned in this column. Also note that an underscore is being used to represent missing data, so this has to handled so that that character is not treated as a gene name that appears many times."
