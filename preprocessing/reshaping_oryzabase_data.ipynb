We need to know what type of information is in each in order to know which should be retained or parsed to form the desired cleaned dataset. We are interested in both gene names that should map to a specific accession (like cms-54257) as well as gene names that are enzyme descriptions (like Ubiquitin-Specific Protease) that could map to more than one gene in a particular species. Each type of information is valuable, but needs to be differentiated so that when comparing whether two rows are specifying the same gene, this is not confused with specifying two different genes that have the same function.\n",

Also note that an underscore is being used to represent missing data, so this has to handled so that that character is not treated as a gene name that appears many times."

    "### Part 3: Handling other text description and keyword information in this data\n",
    "This dataset does not contain any columns that consistly contain a natural language description of a phenotype associated with a given gene. But some text-based information is still present. The trait class column contains a value from a limited set of keyword descriptors for the trait a particular gene is associated with. The size of the vocabulary used is obtained here. Also see the specific description of this keyword vocabulary here (https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/traitclass/). The explaination column also occasionally contains text information about a corresponding phenotype."
