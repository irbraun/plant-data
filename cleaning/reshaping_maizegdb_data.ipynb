    "## Reading in data available through Maize GDB (Maize Genetics and Genomics Database)\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to read in and do a preliminary analysis of the data related to text descriptions that are available through Maize GDB. The data was provided in the form of the input file by a request through Maize GDB curators, rather than obtained through an already available file from the database. The data needs to be organized and also restructured into a standard format that will allow it to be easily combined with datasets from other resources. This notebook takes the following input files that were obtained from MaizeGDB and produces a set of files that have standard columns that are listed and described below.\n",

Galinate writes in MNL 64:  The interspace (is) factor exposes a bare face of rachis between the apex (upper lip) of the cupule and the glume cushion of the diverging spikelet(s) above. Botanically, the interspace represents the backside of the internode from the alternate rachis segment (phytomer). When condensation is sufficiently low for the length of the interspace to become equal to the length of the cupule below, then there is enough extra space to interlock the pedicellate member from an adjacent pair while the sessile member stays in line with its cupule row. The result is a 50% reduction in the kernel-row number.',\n",
