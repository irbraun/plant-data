3	mtr	Medtr3g021350|cyp716A12|Medtr3g021180	lha	Impaired hemolytic saponin synthesis. Plant growth stunted. A cytochrome P450 gene (CYP716A12) is involved in an early step in saponin biosynthesis and is found in most tissues.  CYP716A12 loss-of-function mutants do not produce hemolytic saponins and only synthetize soyasaponins, and were thus named lacking hemolytic activity (lha).  CYP716A12 catalyzes the oxidation of _-amyrin and erythrodiol at the C-28 position, yielding oleanolic acid. Transcriptome changes in the lha mutant showed a modulation in the main steps of the triterpenic saponin biosynthetic pathway, which includes squalene cyclization, _-amyrin oxidation, and glycosylation.  Growth of homozygous lha/lha plants was stunted.	GO:0016135|PATO:0001236|PATO:0000460|PO:0000003|PATO:0000587	Plant PhenomeNET

Mutant floret has 3 ovaries. female fertile. a mutant floret has degenerated lemma and palea, so that they fail to enclose the stamens and pistil. The mutant does not produce normal stamens and is thus male sterile. Usually, one floret forms one caryopsis. Although mutant is male sterile, it can produce seeds when pollinated with pollen from wild type plants. In that case one or two naked seeds can be formed in a single floret. So, the mutant is female fertile. In general, a mutant floret contains many pistils but no stamens, indicating that the stamens are transformed to pistils. In some mutant florets, pistilloid stamens containing a filament tipped by malformed tissue and deformed stigma or one to three stigmas were observed. In the cross section of a wild type floret six filaments representing the six stamens and an ovary representing the pistil in the middle can be seen clearly, while in a mutant floret, some filaments and some pistilloid tissues, e.g., the ovary-like or malformed tissues are observed. The pistilloid tissues are counterparts of the wild type stamens. In the longitudinal section of a mutant floret, three ovaries can be seen clearly. .

Stomatal distribution is  affected in cotyledons. plants have fewer stomata than wild-type plants, and the stomata are frequently larger than those of wild-type plants. Trichomes of the first rosette leaves are strongly deformed.

The gynoecia of double mutants showed severe reduction of the ovary and morphological abnormalities in the apical region that were similar  to ett strong allele mutant phenotypes. Occasionally, inflorescences of the double mutant failed to produce any normal flower buds, resulting in pin-like structures that were not found in either stv1 or ett single mutants. Pin-like inflorescences are formed in mp, pid, and pin1 mutants and in wild-type plants treated with polar auxin transport inhibitors. The gynoecial defects of ett-1 mutants, such as reduction in ovary size and increased gynophore elongation, were enhanced by the sty1-1 mutation. A number of double mutant gynoecia were nearly completely valveless, and in those, ovules grew on top of a placental surface. In addition, the apical ends of sty1-1 ett-1 gynoecia were less fused than those of ett-1 and sty1-1, and ovules frequently protruded at the apex. The amount of stylar and stigmatic tissues was reduced compared with ett-1, and the double mutant was sterile.

69	ath	At5g06070|RBE|AT5G06070		Abnormal petal morphology.  Altered petal morphology. A wild-type flower has four petals of almost the same size and shape. A petal is flat from top to bottom, and the bottom part is narrow and greenish. In rbe-1, petals were deformed and their degree of morphological abnormality varied from a mild phenotype of a reduced blade at the top, an intermediate phenotype of spoon-shaped petals with a small blade and a short filamentous stalk at the base, to a severe phenotype of filaments only. In some cases, no petals or filaments were observed at the position of petal formation. . The epidermal cells on the lower surface of the filaments of rbe-1 had an irregular ridged structure similar to that of the lower surface of the wild type, but the cells were flattened and elliptic. The position of the filamentous petals was normal. that is, they were formed in the second whorl at a position between the medial and lateral sepals. Furthermore, in the small or spoon-shaped petals of rbe-1, the epidermal cells had a ridged structure and were smaller . This suggests that the position and identity of the aberrant-shaped petals of rbe was not altered. . Defective in petal development. petals are transformed to filamentous organs, or lost. ovules have shorter integuments than those of wild type, producing shorter siliques. reduced fertility. strong allele. Defective in sepal, petal, and ovule development. flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals. petals are often reduced in size or altered  in appearance, petals often absent or replaced by staminoid organs and filaments. altered integument growth in ovules. reduced fertility. During stage 3 of flower development, four sepal primordia are initiated in normal positions in rbe-3 mutants. However, early in stage 4 some rbe-3 sepal primordia have undergone extra growth along their margins and appear wider than normal. The tips of these primordia were sometimes not located in the middle of the primordia and the two sides of the primordia were not symmetrical. Continued uneven growth of these primordia became more pronounced during development. By stage 5, an organ that had presumably initiated as a single primordium now appeared as two fused primordia or two closely spaced and partially fused primordia. . In rbe-3 flowers, second-whorl petals are often reduced in size or altered in appearance. Petals with staminoid characteristics, stamens, filaments or the absence of organs can all be found in the second whorl of rbe-3 mutants. Mutant flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals. More than four sepals were observed in approximately 7% of rbe-3 flowers, while some degree of sepal fusion was observed in 35% of flowers (corresponding to 10% of all sepals). In rbe-3 flowers with more than four sepals, the extra sepal was thinner than the remaining four sepals. In some cases, one of the adjacent sepals was  also somewhat reduced in width. Sepal fusion can occur in the absence of more than four sepals. Sepal fusion was observed most often at the base of these organs and more rarely along their entire length. We measured the width of mature sepals to determine whether  sepal fusion might be due to wider organs. rbe-3 sepals were 12% wider than Landsberg erecta (Ler) sepals at maturity. Same phenotype as ag-1 single mutants with completely normal petals developing in the second whorl. In addition, sepal number was normal in these flowers and no cases of sepal fusion were observed. Double mutants had an increased number of sepals compared with either single mutant. In early arising flowers as many as eight sepals were present. In addition, fusion between sepals was observed in ant-4 rbe-3 mutants. Sepals in the double mutant were often fused along their entire length rather than just at their base as usually seen in rbe-3. . Mutant flowers also show a reduction in the overall number of second-whorl organs. In addition, fewer filaments and staminoid organs were present in the double mutant compared with rbe-3 single mutants. Reduced stamen number in the third whorl of ant-4 mutants was partially rescued by rbe-3. Additive phenotype in the first and fourth whorls. Second-whorl organs of the double mutant were more completely converted to stamens or were missing entirely. . The enhancement of the second-whorl phenotypes in these double mutants resulted from AG misexpression. In the double mutants, first-whorl carpels and staminoid carpels were often wider than in ap2-2. These organs had the appearance of several fused organs but were only connected to the base of the flower in the central part of the organ and were in a position normally occupied by a single organ. In addition, first-whorl organs were often fused along much of their length. All of the first-whorl organs were sometimes fused such that the fourth whorl carpel poked through a ring of tissue. Cells present along the margin of fusion resembled the epidermal cells normally present on the abaxial replum of wild-type carpels. . The number of first whorl organs in the double mutant was slightly increased compared with ap2-2 single mutants. No second-whorl organs were present in the double mutant and the third and fourth whorls had an additive phenotype. leaf curling similar to that in clf-2. Both clf-2 and clf-2 rbe-3 produced an average of 4.0 second-whorl organs per flower. In clf-2 mutants these were almost exclusively small petals whereas the average number of small petals in clf-2 rbe-3 was 1.37. Second-whorl petals were most often replaced by spoonshaped petals, staminoid petals, petaloid stamens or stamens. . Four distinct sepal primordia are initiated in a normal pattern during stage 3 of flower development as was seen previously for cuc2-1 and rbe-3 single mutants. Later growth of sepal primordia in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double is uneven, similar to that seen in rbe-3 single mutants. An increased extent of sepal fusion in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double mutant as compared with cuc2-1 was first observed during stage 6. In double mutant flowers, sepal fusion occurred more often and to a greater extent than in either single mutant. . Additive phenotype. The number of second-whorl organs was reduced in lug-1 rbe-3 double mutants and these remaining organs were primarily staminoid. Thus, rbe-3 enhanced the second-whorl phenotype of lug-1 mutants. The double mutant rarely produced any seeds, suggesting a more severe defect in female fertility in the double mutant compared with either single mutant. However, no enhancement of the outer integument growth defect was observed. Double-mutant flowers have a phenotype that is similar to ufo-11 flowers. Double mutant has the same phenotype as the ufo-2 single mutant. There is no increase in the number of filaments and/or staminoid organs in the double mutant as compared with ufo-2.

In the case of CSN3, the complete loss of function of CSN5 results in the accumulation of a larger and possibly modified CSN3 form, whereas the normal (smaller) CSN3 form is present predominantly in wild type. In the homozygous progeny, anthocyanin accumulation (purple coloration) in the cotelydons of developing embryos. Mutation is lethal in the homozygous state. A residual derubylation activity can be observed in the double mutant seedlings. At 6 to 7 DAG, the double mutants uniformly start to form the first pair of true leaves and eventually develop into impaired small plantlets, with dark red cotyledons and asymmetrical leaves. None of the double mutants arrest at the seedling stage, and even though severely compromised, mutant plantlets survive to a mature stage. . Synergistic phenotype: de-etiolated, fusca seedlings. Dark grown plants undergo photomorphogenesis. hypocotyl elongation ,cotyledon expansion, anthocyanin accumulation in cotyledons. Mutants are virtually indistinguishable from wild-type plants at all developmental stages (germination, vegetative and reproductive). No detectable changes in the cellular pools of COP9 signalosome complex subunits. Mutants are virtually indistinguishable  from wild-type siblings in the dark and in all light conditions, both at seedling and mature stages.

Reduced phototropism.  impaired phototropic and gravitropic response in hypocotyls. reduced numbers of lateral roots. epinastic rosette leaves. reduced auxin sensitivity in hypocotyl growth. The double mutant exhibits much stronger auxin-related phenotypes than those of the  single mutants. Adult double mutant plants have thin and short inflorescence stems, and their rosette leaves are small and epinastic. In addition, it has reduced numbers of inflorescence stems, suggesting enhanced apical dominance. By contrast, its flowers appear to be  normal, and they fertilize normally. The double mutant mutant displays agravitropic responses in both hypocotyls and roots. When seedlings are grown vertically under dark conditions, the regulation of growth orientation is disrupted in both hypocotyls and roots, with the hypocotyls occasionally growing downward and the roots upward. Also, the roots and hypocotyls of the double mutant show reduced gravitropic curvatures compared with the wild type when vertically dark-grown seedlings are reoriented by 90°. The phenotype of the double mutant is most obvious at its seedling stage, with its most prominent phenotype being severely impaired  lateral root formation. Its primary roots fail to produce lateral roots in 2-week-old seedlings. However, double mutant seedlings start to generate several lateral roots after ~2 weeks of growth, and their morphological appearance is normal.

Seedlings grown in the dark on sirtinol show long hypocotyls but no apical hook, have primary roots and are resistant to IAA and 2,4-D.  In the dark, hypocotyls but not roots are resistant to 2,4-D.  There is no obvious difference between wt and mutants grown on 2,4-D in the light. Dark grown seedlings on sirtinol have both long primary roots and long hypocotyls.  More resistant to 2,4-D and IAA than single mutants in both light and dark.  The ethylene resistant root phenotype of arf19-101 is enhanced by arf7-201. Gravitropic curvature similar to that of wildtype (Col) when dark-grown. Over time however, the curvature becomes intermediate between that of the nph4 single mutant and wildtype. In the presence of 1 microM brassinazole, an inhibitor of brassinolide biosynthesis, the mutant hypocotyls display the same gravitropic time course as that of wildtype. Leaves and cotyledons are only weakly epinastic. Mutant hypocotyls are more sensitive to IAA treatment (inhibition of growth) than those of wildtype. Similar phototropic response of etiolated hypocotyls compared to that of wildtype. Hypocotyl growth resistant (but not root growth) to 2,4-D inhibition compared to wildtype. Mature mutant plants are largely wildtype in phenotype apart for the morphology of the rosette leaves. Root growth significantly reduced (about two-third of that of wildtype) when grown in white light. Rosette leaves are somewhat epinatic albeit less so than those of msg1-2. Slower gravitropic response than wildtype, although the final curvatures are comparable. Dramatically reduced phototropic response. Phenotype not described. Strongly epinastic rosette leaves. About half of the rosette leaves are epinastic, the remaining half was hyponastic. Gravitropic response of dark-grown mutant hypocotyls is slower than that of wildtype (Col). Mutant hypocotyls are more resistant to IAA treatment (inhibition of growth) than wildtype. Slower phototropic response of etiolated hypocotyl compared to wildtype. When grown on 2,4-D-containing medium, the hyponastic rosette leaves become flat. Decreased density of lateral roots. Synergistic interaction. Mutant produces fewer lateral roots compared with the wild type. When seedlings are grown vertically under dark conditions, the hypocotyl growth orientation of mutant is significantly skewed compared with the wild type.

A closer inspection of these fruits showed that they had developed enlarged repla with more cells than those of the wild type. The number of outer epidermal cells in mutant valves was smaller, causing a reduction in valve width. The alteration produced in fruits by the as1  mutation was partially alleviated in the double mutants. Repla were narrow, practically reverting to the appearance of the wild type, and numbers of cells in both repla and valves were different from those of the as1 mutants. Partial rescue of the rpl repla phenotype. Showed large repla and a reduction in valve width. Double mutant displayed extremely small valves, and very large, rough and distorted repla, indicating a strong enhancement of the phenotypes of the two single mutants both in valves and replum. Leaf phenotypes are enhanced with respect to either single mutant, with deeply lobed margins and ectopic stipules present in the sinus of each lobe. Ectopic stipules observed in cauline leaves of as1.axr1 plants are not found.  Leaves have an as1-like morphology.

Complete loss of auxiliary inflorescences.  pleiotropic mutation that strongly affects both vegetative and reproductive development. rosette leaves prior to bolting appear normal. as bolting begins, the youngest rosette leaves progressively become abnormally large and distorted or uneven in shape. cauline leaves are longer and narrower than wild type, are curved downward (revolute) along their longitudinal axes and have rolled-under margins. secondary and axillary shoots frequently fail to develop in both rosette and cauline axils, which may either be empty or contain small filamentous structures usually bearing branched trichomes. both the leaves and the primary shoots are often darker green than wild type stems are thick. few fertile flowers are produced, but most floral meristems either form sterile flowers missing pistils and stamens or filamentous structures that resemble abortive pedicels. Plants exhibit reduced lateral shoot meristems (LSMs) of rosette and cauline leaves, meristem-defective flowers, altered leaf morphology (size and shape) and leaf color. The percentage of absent LSMs is correlated with the severity of leaf morphology and color, the severity of leaf morphology and color is also correlated with the % of meristem-defective flowers. however, the % of absent LSMs is independent of the % of meristem-defective flowers. Plants exhibit reduced lateral shoot meristems (LSMs) of rosette and cauline leaves. approximately 70% of cauline leaves lack a lateral meristem and 16% fail to produce meristems in the axils of any rosette leaves. decapitation of the primary shoot meristem (SAM) fails to stimulate axillary meristem formation. in the place of axillary meristems, the axils of affected leaves are usually bare, but occasionally develop a differentiated structure that is a leaf or a filamentous structure. Reduced flower meristem activity, while the majority of the flowers develop normally, 12% of the flowers initiate only a limited set of flower organs and appear to have a defective flower meristem. the inner organs are preferentially absent from flowers with defective meristems. in affected flowers, the floral meristem is reduced in size or nearly absent by stage 3 of flower development. other flowers are identical to wild-type.

In addition, mutant plants tend to grow slightly more slowly than do wild-type plants. With the exception of the collapsed xylem phenotype, both the organization of the vascular tissue and the organization of the entire stem of the three irx mutants are identical to that of the wild type. In addition to stems, the collapsed xylem phenotype of irx plants has been observed in mature hypocotyls and in the primary root and petioles. collapsed xylem, unable to grow upright, dark green leaves and slightly dwarf. height=10-12cm. Phenotype not described. The homozygous double mutants progeny were severely dwarfed and sterile. The leaves were dark green, indicating an increase in chloroplasts per leaf area of the mutants, which was probably due to the reduced cell size. Several double mutant plants were unable to bolt and only grew rosette leaves. The homozygous mutant progeny are severely  deformed and are smaller in size compared with the wild type, possibly reflecting a reduction in water transporting ability. Similar phenotype to that of the irx8-2 irx1-1 double mutant. Grown under normal conditions mutant plants show weaker or no wilting phenotype.  Mutant leaves become wilty after plants are transferred from normal conditions to higher transpiration conditions for 6 hrs, whereas wt plants did not show the leaf-wilting phenotype under the same conditions.  Mutants are more resistant to drought and to osmotic stresss in both germination and growth.

Produces abaxial trichomes precociously. kan1 kan2 double mutants have small, up-curled leaves with abaxial protrusions, and are sterile. About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature. . Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype. . bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems had a decreased ratio of adaxialized vascular phenotypes compared with kan1 kan2 stems. Similar to what was observed in petioles, 6.7% of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems exhibited an abaxialized phenotype of xylem surrounded by phloem, while others (13.3%) had both types of vasculature in a single stem. Ectopic adaxial tissues are restricted to the medial domain of the carpels, normally occupied by the abaxial replum.  Formation of external ovule-bearing placentae. Altered abaxial identity in leaves and carpels. Similar to kan1 kan2 double mutant.  However, the ovules have a novel phenotype, forming a single amorphous structure in place of both integuments. A few external ovules develop at the base of the gynoecium and straps of ectopic style from along the abaxial replum. Phenotype is present primarily in the first formed carpels. All kan1 kan2 stem vascular bundles displayed phloem surrounded by xylem, indicating adaxialized polarity. Cotyledons are narrow, cup-shaped and point upward. Leaves are narrow, dark green and develop ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial side only.  Four to six stipules, rather than two, develop at the base of each leaf, surrounding its entire circumference.  Stems fail to elongate upon flowering.  Floral organ morphology is highly abnormal.  Mature ovules have reduced outer integuments. Aberrant positioning of cell types, primarily along the adaxial/abaxial lateral organ axis. Double mutant plants have narrow leaves and developed ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina. . External structures of the carpel are largely absent.  Ovules arise from a surface or column of tissue at the center of the flower. The inner integuments of these ovules are normal but the asymmetrical outer integument is now a nearly symmetrical and relatively amorphous collar of tissue. The vasculature in more than half (55.9%) of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles exhibited a pattern of phloem surrounded by xylem, representing an adaxialized phenotype. However, very surprisingly, 17.6% of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles had abaxialized vasculature or a mixture of adaxialized and abaxialized vasculature. Radialized leaf like organs form on the hypocotyl.

Weak semidominant ppd silique phenotype, i.e., similar to deltappd mutant, and leaf curvature phenotype. Mutant plants had larger leaf and cotyledon laminae, and leaves had a dome-shaped, positive Gaussian curvature, in contrast to flat WT leaves. Mutant siliques were shorter, flattened, and wider at the top and had undulations in the seedpod walls, compared with the smooth, narrow, cylindrical shape of WT siliques. Branching of trichomes on mutant leaves was reduced, to two rather than the three to four branches of WT. The larger lamina area observed in the leaves and cotyledons of mutant plants was due to increases in both length and width. For cotyledons, this increase in growth occurred without affecting shape or flatness. However, mature leaves in mutant plants were more oval in shape because of an altered lamina length-to-width ratio and could not be flattened without introducing cuts in the margin because of their positive curvature.

Lipid catabolism during germination and early post-germinative growth was delayed in the acx2-1 mutant, with 3-day-old seedlings accumulating long-chain acyl-CoAs. Mutant plants have reduced medium- and long-chain Acyl-CoA enzyme activity. Seedling growth and establishment in the absence of an exogenous supply of sucrose was unaffected.  Unlike acx1-1 mutants, jasmonic acid accumulation was not reduced upon wounding of mutant plants when compared to the wild type. Double mutant seedlings were unable to catabolize seed storage lipids and accumulated long-chain acyl-CoAs. The acx1-1 acx2-1 seedlings were also unable to establish photosynthetic competency in the absence of an exogenous carbon supply, a phenotype that is shared with a number of other Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in storage lipid breakdown. Germination frequency of the double mutant was significantly reduced compared with wild-type seeds. This was unaffected by the addition of exogenous sucrose, but was improved by dormancy-breaking treatments such as cold stratification and after-ripening.  Peroxisomes in the cotyledons were enlarged in double mutants, while in single mutants (acx1-1 and acx2-1) peroxisomes were identical to the wild type.

Epidermal strips of pip5k4  plants treated with exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 were  incubated in medium containing 10 &mu.M PtdIns(4,5)P2 and  irradiated with white light, after which stomatal apertures  were measured. A reduction in  the light-induced opening of peeled epidermis was observed compared  with that in detached whole leaves. Stomatal apertures  reached maximal opening after 4 h of illumination. The  stomatal apertures of PtdIns(4,5)P2-treated pip5k4 (2.94 &mu.m) were similar to those of WT (3.02 &mu.m), and significantly larger than those of pip5k4  without treatment (2.32 &mu.m).  The stomatal apertures of PtdIns(4)P- and PtdIns(3,4)P2-  treated pip5k4 plants were not significantly different from  those of untreated pip5k4 plants. . Under natural light, the pip5k4 mutant exhibited delayed  stomatal opening, and this phenotype was  confirmed by performing a stomatal opening test in the dark  or under white light irradiation. At the beginning  of the photoperiod (T = 0 h), the apertures of pip5k4 stomata  did not differ significantly from WT, whereas after  3 h of illumination with 170 &#956.mol m-2 sec-1 white light, the  mean aperture size of pip5k4 stomata (2.78 &#956.m) was  significantly smaller than that of WT. Pollen harvested from pip5k4 pip5k5 mutants germinates at a lower rate than wild type pollen, and pollen tube growth is slowed. However, the general shape of the pollen tubes is normal.

Severe leaf chlorosis at low temperature.  ABA-regulated seed germination was unaffected under the experimental conditions used. Although ggt1-1 did not affect cold tolerance of plants kept in the dark, mutant plants subjected to cold and light treatment exhibited severe leaf chlorosis. This light sensitivity of ggt1-1 could be alleviated either by reduced light intensity or by growth on media containing sucrose. . In the absence of ABA treatment, root elongation of ggt1-1 was reduced nearly 50% compared to wild-type. Mutant leaves were stained with NBT or DAB: the results indicated an increased level of H2O2 but little difference in O2- . This difference in H2O2 was further investigated by quantitative determination of seedling H2O2 using an Amplex Red assay. Light grown ggt1-1 seedlings, but not dark grown seedlings, had increased levels of H2O2 relative to wild-type. Mutant plants had a pale green color and grew more slowly than wild-type. Proline accumulation was higher in untreated ggt1-1 seedlings and also increased to a higher than wild-type level upon ABA treatment. The mutant shows a reduction in ABA-responsive RD29A expression. In ggt1-1, expression of RD29A:LUC was approximately one-third of the wild-type level at 3 h after application of 100 &mu.M ABA. . Same phenotype as ggt1-1. Increased chlorosis in older leaves when compared with wild-type and smaller rosette diameter.  ggt1-2 plants bolted approximately 3 days earlier than the wild-type plants.  Yellowing leaves in the ggt1-2 mutant was caused by oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation levels increased . This mutant plant has reduced levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activity, with the magnitude of reduction differing between organs. GGT is reduced by about 90% in leaves and flowers. These mutants are significantly smaller than wild-type plants and have higher levels of chlorosis.

Whereas irx8 and irx9 contain ~40 to 50% xylose compared with the wild type, the double mutant contained only ~20% xylose compared with wild-type plants. . Although irx9 mutants have a reduction in xylose levels, they retain the ability to form the oligosaccharide leader present at the reducing end of xylan chains. However, they appear to be defective in xylan chain elongation. Their xylan chains seem to show the normal branching pattern found in wild type xylan chains, but glucuronic acid (GlcUA) is largely replaced by methylglucuronic acid (MeGlcUA). They are capable of accumulating cellulose throughout development, but they have lower total cellulose levels than WT plants at middle and late developmental stages. The wall thickness of interfascicular fibers and vessels in the stems of the mutants was decreased by ~60% compared with the wild type, which is most likely the cause of their reduced stem strength. irx9 mutants of Arabidopsis showed a decrease in the abundance of xylan as revealed by cell wall analysis.

The lacs1-1 lacs2-3 double mutants had a synergistic phenotype, compared to either of the single mutants, with drastically reduced stem wax and cutin contents, increased cuticle permeability, and severe male sterile in low humidity. Mutant leaves were small and irregular in shape compared with the wild type. Both surfaces of mutant leaves differed from the wild type. Adaxial surfaces of the wild type showed the characteristic jigsaw puzzle shape of pavement cells. In the mutant, the cells contained fewer, larger lobes. Epidermal cells on the abaxial surface of mutants were collapsed. This collapsed appearance was consistently seen in views of the abaxial leaf surface of mutant plants but was never observed on the abaxial surface of wild-type leaves or on the adaxial surfaces of either the wild-type or mutant plants. Mutant rosettes were slower to flower than wildtype plants (34.1 d versus 30.2 d under a 16-h photoperiod). Mutant plants produced smaller bolts, but flower morphology and fertility were normal, and siliques were similar in size to those on wild-type plants. The smaller bolts of the mutant yielded only 62 mg seed/plant compared with 177 mg seed/plant from wild-type controls. Harvested mutant seeds appeared smaller and darker than seeds from wild-type plants that had been grown alongside the mutants. Examination by light microscopy revealed that 50% of mutant seeds contained green embryos that could be distinguished through the testa. When the green and normal brown seeds from a mutant plant were germinated separately, the green seeds showed 79% germination compared with 100% germination for the brown seeds. Only 80.0% of mutant seedlings emerged. At 6 d, a percentage of the emerged mutant seedlings would not grow and develop into viable plants. These seedlings had white cotyledons, and they eventually died. At 19 d, 91.0% of the wild-type seeds that germinated had produced viable rosettes with four to five pairs of true leaves. For the mutants, only 72.2% of seeds that had germinated (58% of those sown) produced rosettes. At this stage, the mutant had only two to three pairs of true leaves. Reduced-growth phenotype. The cutin layer on the adaxial surface of mutant leaves was not significantly different in cross-sectional thickness from that of control wild-type leaves. However, the abaxial cutin layer on mutant leaves was substantially thinner than the wild type. The rate of chlorophyll leaching from mutant plants was threefold higher than the rate from wild-type controls. Increased cuticle permeability compared with WT. Strongly resistant to infection with Botrytis cinerea strain: infection sites on mutant leaves remained usually symptom free, in contrast to those on Col leaves. A number of ester-bound monomers were reduced in the mutant. Increased resistance to Botrytis infection: the visual phenotypes of the leaves 3 days after inoculation show that the lesions larger than the original infection site represent only 5% of lesions compared to 75% in WT plants. Similar phenotype to that described for lacs2-2. The distinct osmium-dense cuticular membrane  representing insoluble lipid-derived polymers such as cutin, visible at the epidermal outer extracellular matrix of WT plants, could not be seen at the leaf epidermis of the mutant. The remaining outer epidermal extracellular matrix sometimes had a distinct laminated structure. The mutant showed severe damage at a lower concentration of BASTA compared with WT Col-0 plants. The rate of water loss from the mutant is significantly higher than that of Col-0 plants. The total amount of omega-hydroxylated fatty acids and their derivatives was reduced 4- to 5-fold in the mutant compared with Col-0. The impact of mutation on the amount of dicarboxylic acids, characteristic of Arabidopsis cutin, was particularly strong, and the amount was reduced to 15-20% of WT amount.

Increased branching. Abnormal root gravitropism, lateral root formation, and root hair growth. Reduced fertility. Insensitive to auxin.  suppressor of superoot2-1 phenotype. Homozygous axr1-12 plants that are heterozygous for axl-1 display severe growth defects. These seedlings developed short, slow growing roots compared with wild-type roots, and were arrested at the late seedling stage. Plants with the genotype AXL/axl-1 axr1-12/axr1-12 had a slight but consistent reduction in RUB-CUL1 levels. . The axr1-12/axr1-12 AXL/axl-1 line are nearly completely resistant to auxin, a much more severe phenotype than for axr1-12 alone. The columella of AXL/axl-1 axr1-12/axr1-12 root tips is highly disorganized during early seedling root growth, and is completely disrupted at the time when root growth ceases. Altered DR5:GUS expression. irregular rosette leaves, tend to curl downward. short petioles. slightly reduced plant height. increased number of lateral branches (ca. 2x). Decrease in SCF<sup>TIR1</sup> ligase activity. Reduced RUB modification of CUL1. Slight decrease in the number of columella columns in axr1-12 seedlings compared with wild type. The mutant is resistant to auxin. irregular rosette leaves (same as axr1-3 except more pronounced). plant height reduced to less than half of wild type. inflorescences more highly branched. reduced fertility. Reduced height, crinkled leaves, partial male sterility, and susceptible to Pythium irregulare infection. Decreased sensitivity to methyl jasmonate (MeJA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), 6-benzylamino-purine (BAP), epi-brassinolide, and abscisic acid (ABA). Decreased sensitivity to MeJA-induced root growth inhibition. Increased susceptibility to Pythium irregulare infection compared to single mutants jar1-1 and axr1-3. GUS expression at root tip under alkaline stress conditions. auxin resistant. irregular rosette leaves, slightly curled around leaf axis. roots very auxin resistant. defective root gravitropism. reduced number of lateral roots. plant appearance similar to axr1-12, but more pronounced. dwarf, bushy plants. reduced plant height. reduced fertility. Leaf phenotypes are enhanced with respect to either single mutant, with deeply lobed margins and ectopic stipules present in the sinus of each lobe. Ectopic stipules observed in cauline leaves of as1.axr1 plants are not found.  Leaves have an as1-like morphology. Double homozygous mutant seedlings are completely deficient in RUB-modified CUL1. Double homozygous progeny has severe growth and developmental defects. The phenotype of these plants resembled the bdl/iaa12 and mp/arf5 mutants. These seedlings did not segregate at the expected 1/16 ratio. Instead, we identified three double mutant seedlings in 176 F2 plants, suggesting the homozygous double mutants are arrested during embryogenesis. . In the double mutant progeny, great reduction in vascular development. The AXR1/axr1-12, axl-1/axl-1 plants were similar to wild type with respect to overall morphology and fertility. The double homozygous progeny is seedling lethal. Very strong embryo defects were observed in homozygous axl-1 plants segregating the axr1-12 mutation. The triple mutant had an approximately additive phenotype. They were bushy and displayed the reduced fertility of axr1-12 plants.

Reduced apical dominance, organ clustering, altered phyllotaxis, aberrant internode elongation, flowers form filamentous gynoecia, aborted organs along the inflorescence. Two types of flowers are seen: a) flowers with sepals and petals, displaying sepal/petal mosaic organ and filamentous petals. and b) flowers lacking petals. Few siliques formed. Partial rescue of the rpl repla phenotype. Shoot apex arrests prematurely in less than 50% of double mutants. This occurs around 2 weeks post germination or after 8 or so sets of leaves are made. The meristems are reduced in size. After growth resumption new, abnormally shaped leaves are produced and the plants eventually flower. In triple mutants the primary apical meristem terminates after germination-usually being consumed in the formation of a single terminal leaf. Growth can resume with the formation of new meristems however the phyllotaxy is abnormal. Fruits of this double mutant exhibited a more severe replumless phenotype than rpl-2, similar to that shown by the strong rpl-3 mutant. Additive with respect to both single mutants. short internodes, down-ward orientation of siliques and organ clusters. Increased branching. Fruit defects. pny phenotype.

Plants do not flower and continue to produce leaves even after 200 days in long-day inductive conditions. Shoot meristems initiated only leaves.  SAMs respond to floral inductive signals but fail to induce floral meristem identity genes. Phyllotaxy in both reproductive and vegetative meristems is altered so that two organs are produced per node vs. the usual one. Shoot apical meristem terminates prematurely. phyllotaxy defects. Partial loss of apical dominance, dwarfed. defects in replum differentiation and septum fusion. Repla exhibit stripes of narrow cells very  similar to those of the valve margin. Inflorescence was shorter in stature than the wild-type inflorescence. In addition, two to three more paraclades developed in this mutant than in wild-type plants. The paraclades had a highly penetrant defect that affected the first one or two internodes. These internodes were dramatically reduced in length, giving the appearance of leaves initiating in the axils of the cauline leaves. The internodes on the main stem between the paraclades also often were reduced in size. The pedicels of flowers in pny were slightly shorter than those found in the wild type. Finally, flowers occasionally were aberrant, producing small, curved, club-shaped siliques at a low penetrance. Vegetative development appeared normal in pny plants. . Whereas the internode length was relatively constant in wild-type plants, whereas close examination of the inflorescence in pny showed that internodes between the siliques often were absent or reduced severely. This internode defect appears to be random, because normal-sized internodes were interspersed along the stem. Clusters of siliques often were visible on the  inflorescences stems, indicating that the internode defect could span a large region of the shoot. .

More severe inflorescence phenotype were found in this mutant compared to the atcand1-1 (ems-generated) mutation. Mutant plants were completely sterile. Mutants resistant to sirtinol and auxin, but not to gibberellins or brassinolide. Displayed developmental phenotypes similar to those of axr1, namely, short petioles, downwardly curling leaves, short inflorescence, and reduced fertility. Similar to cand1-2 and cand1-3 mutants. Rosette leaves of mutants plants were much smaller than those of wild-type plants and had a wavy morphology. Mutants flowered later than wild-type plants, with an increased number of rosette leaves indicating that the vegetative to reproductive growth transition of the primary shoot apical meristem was affected. The growth of axillary meristems is also abnormal, where a large number of smaller leaves are produced. Furthermore, the mutants have very low fertility, with less than one seed produced on average per silique. Mutant plants continued to make new flowers while wild-type plants of the same age started to senesce. Other notable phenotypes of cand1 mutants include dwarfism and loss of apical dominance. When examined closely, dwarfism largely results from reduced stem elongation. Mutant plants had a strong increase in the number of secondary inflorescences, an indication that they have lost apical dominance. When grown in darkness, mutant seedlings exibited mild photomorphogenic phenotypes, with short hypocotyls and opened cotyledons. Cotyledon areoles (regions of the lamina completely bordered by veins) were often incompletely closed, while in the wild type, the cotyledons contained three or four complete areoles. The reduction in vein numbers was also apparent in the first two rosette leaves, which had fewer secondary veins than the wild type. No quaternary veins and only a few tertiary veins, which ended blindly within the areoles, were present in mutant leaves, the intramarginal vein of which was occasionally interrupted.

These vcs-7 embryos contained small dense cells in the SAM region. however, this region was not dome-shaped, nor were the cells organized into distinct layers. The transheterozygote was indistinguishable from vcs-1. it produced green organs, a longer root, and leaves that expanded to become broad and pointed. 29°C-grown vcs apices contained multiple clusters of small densely staining cells dispersed across the apical region and often in close proximity to leaf-like structures, but no  typical SAM. Accumulates extra ectopic tracheary elements within their cotyledons and the upper hypocotyl. Smaller than the wild type, and produced  narrow, asymmetric leaves when grown at  22°C. All five mutant alleles showed identical phenotypic responses to growth temperature. When grown at 16°C, vcs mutants resembled the wild-type controls except their leaves were pointed at the apex, and prolonged growth revealed defects in apical dominance. By contrast, growth at 29°C resulted in a strongly enhanced phenotype. These high temperature-grown mutants were chlorotic, leaves were narrow and epinastic, and prolonged growth resulted in a  callus-like growth at the apex. vcs roots  appeared similar to those of wild type,  except that at high temperature root hairs  occasionally appeared swollen. vcs also produced decreased numbers of lateral roots. The wild-type SAM was similar in size and organ  phyllotaxy regardless of growth temperature. By contrast, the vcs SAM was smaller than the wild type. this defect was most severe in the 29°C-grown vcs plants, where the SAM appeared small and flat. When grown at 22°C, vcs-1 mutants were green, had slightly longer roots, and produced narrow, pointed leaves. Fork-like appearance of cotyledon secondary veins similar to that of vcs-7. Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. The homozygous progeny of these mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology. Cotyledons of wild-type and vcs-1 plants contain a primary vein and four secondary veins that form between two and four closed loops, whereas in vcs-7, the cotyledon secondary veins were mostly free-ending, resulting in a fork-like appearance. Growth of vcs-7 at 16°C resulted in only modest suppression of growth. Mutants produced cotyledons that expanded slowly and accumulated anthocyanins around their margins, hypocotyls that were short and slightly swollen, and root hairs that were short and swollen. These traits were similar to those we reported previously for vcs-1 grown at 29°C. The vcs-7 mutant also showed cotyledon vein pattern defects. . The SAM of the vcs-7 3-d-old seedlings varied: some were modestly rounded and layered, whereas others were more similar to the tdt embryonic SAM. however, none had leaf primordia. When grown at 22°C, vcs-7 mutants had short roots, small chlorotic cotyledons, and typically failed to produce leaf primordia. Appears similar to the single mutants.

Unchallenged plants display substantial callose deposition and autofluorescent compound accumulation around the necrotic lesions. The dwarf phenotype, but not the necrotic lesion phenotype, can be partially suppressed by growth at 26 degrees. Several defense-related transcripts are constitutively up-regulated in nsl1-1 mutants, and salicyclic acid levels are also increased more than four-fold. Double mutant analyses show that the nsl1-1 phenotype is not rescued by the rar1-10 or sgt1b-1 mutations.

Callus-induced roots from the mutant displayed the mutant phenotype when they grew under restrictive conditions. All the mutants responded to a gravitropic stimulus in a manner similar to wild type although the change of the direction of growth was slower than wild type. The greenhouse-grown mutant was slightly dwarfed. When grown on soil, the mutant exhibited reduced growth and smaller leaves. exhibited a decrease in total extractives, and a concomitant increase in total lignins relative to wild-type plants, more H units relative to wild-type lignins in pom1, arabinose was more abundant in the insoluble residue from pom1,. det3/pom1 double mutants were severely compromised with respect to plant growth and development. Many of the det3/pom1 double mutants died before bolting. The pom1/eli1 double mutant was compromised in growth and the rate of development was slow relative to the single mutants. The pom1/eli1 double mutants had very small rosettes, and their leaves accumulated anthocyanins. When grown on media containing 0.5% sucrose, the mutant had reduced root length but no apparent radial cell expansion. Partial reversion of the hypocotyl-elongation defect of pom1-2.

The double mutant has the same flowering time as the svp single mutant. Under standard growing conditions (22°C), only the first three flowers of the double mutant were affected. These flowers had a reduced number of organs. In particular, this reduction concerned the second and third floral whorls that produced three petals and five stamens, whereas wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana flowers have four petals and six stamens. Furthermore, some flowers showed homeotic conversion of sepals into petaloid organs. . When double mutant plants were grown at a higher temperature (>30°C), almost all flowers (90%) were severely affected in contrast with wild-type and single mutant plants that showed no floral phenotype. The double mutant flowers exhibited variable floral defects, and all produced a reduced number of organs. The triple mutant displayed proliferating inflorescence meristems in positions that would normally be occupied by flowers. This phenotype is very similar to the ap1-1 cal-1 double mutant phenotype.

Exhibits spontaneous cell death in leaves after bolting and increased salicylic acid levels and localized cell death after inoculation with Pst DC3000. In contrast to wild type, anthocyanin accumulation did not occur in the senescing mutant rosette leaves. Mutants failed to adapt to the conditions of nitrogen limitation and started senescence much earlier and more rapidly than did wild-type plants supplied with 3 mM nitrate: mutant plants supplied with 10 mM nitrate had a similar pattern of growth and development to wild type. When the nitrate concentration was reduced to 3 mM, the mutant plants started senescence in the fifth rosette leaf at 24 DAG, and after this point senescence progressed rapidly with all rosette leaves showing senescence symptoms at 26 DAG, and the whole rosette dying at 32 DAG. In contrast, wild-type plants displayed no senescence symptoms in the fifth rosette leaf until 32 DAG. In wild-type plants, the process of senescence proceeded slowly and gradually from the fifth to the youngest rosette leaves, and it took at least 2 weeks for all rosette leaves to show the senescence symptoms. The cauline leaves in the mutant plants started senescence at 28 DAG, at least 10 days earlier than those in the wild-type plants. Further, the developing mutant siliques initiated senescence in their tips at 32 DAG, while the wild-type siliques showed no senescence symptoms  throughout their development but accumulated abundant anthocyanin which was not observed in the mutant siliques. The early senescence process was arrested when nitrate was added after depletion. The occurrence (at 24 DAG) and progression (at 28 DAG) of senescence in mutant rosette leaves were not accompanied by a significant reduction in the amounts of nitrogen-containing compounds: nitrate, total amino acids, soluble proteins, and total nitrogen. By contrast, they were largely reduced in the wild-type plants. With the reduction of the nitrate concentration to 1 mM, the occurrence of the senescence phenotype in the rosette leaves of mutant plants was accelerated to 20 DAG, and severe senescence in the developing mutant siliques resulted in their death around 30 DAG without producing viable seeds. Under the same growth condition (1 mM nitrate), wild-type plants did not start senescence in their rosette leaves until 26 DAG, and produced fecund siliques.

Embryo and female gametophyte defective. Incomplete penetrance of endosperm formation without fertilization. 50% defective seeds.  Autonomous seed development is initiated in absence of fertilization, with a penetrance of about 40-50%. autonomous seeds do not contain an embryo but only endosperm. autonomous endosperm development is accompanied by increase in pistil elongation and ovule size, leading to a small developing seed that contains endosperm. Abnormal development of the endosperm posterior pole with a cyst and nodules larger than in the wild type. ectopic location of nodules in the peripheral endosperm. absence of cellularisation and overproliferation at late stages. Embryos are indistinguishable from wild-type siblings during early stages of embryogenesis, visible differences begin at the late globular stage. Gametophytic maternal effect results in embryo lethality. Heterozygous  embryos abort if the mutant allele is  derived from the female, but develop  normally if it is derived from the male. Embryos derived  from mutant eggs abort irrespective of the  paternal contribution. Thus, the mea  mutant displays maternal-effect embryo lethality. . In the homozygous progeny:  During early stages of embryogenesis the  development of mea-1 embryos is indistinguishable  from wild-type siblings in cleared  or sectioned specimens. Visible differences  between wild-type and mea-1 embryos  began at the late globular stage. Globular mea-1 embryos show excess  cell proliferation and enlarge radially  symmetrical. When wild-type embryos  reach the mid to late heart stage, sibling  mea-1 embryos are still globular and contain  small vacuolated cells with curvilinear cell  walls and sometimes irregular cell divisions  in the ground tissue and procambium. Suspensor  and hypophysis are normal, and cotyledons  initiate synchronously as in the  wild type. Thus, despite increased cell proliferation  and occasional irregular cytokinesis,  morphogenetic progression is normal.  However, each stage is prolonged and includes  more division cycles, and morphogenesis  is delayed. As a consequence, giant  heart stage mea-1 embryos  are present along with late torpedo or cotyledonary  stage wild-type embryos. mea-1  heart stage embryos have supernumerary  cell layers. When wild-type siblings are  fully differentiated, most mea-1 embryos  have reached the late heart stage and are up  to 10 times larger than normal. mea embryos  degenerate during desiccation. These results  suggest that mea controls cell proliferation  during embryogenesis, allowing morphogenesis  to progress normally, albeit  slowly.  Endosperm development in mea-1 seeds  is indistinguishable from that of the wild  type at early stages. When cellularization  begins normally in wild-type seeds at the  transition from the globular to the heart  stage, no cellularization is observed in sibling  mea-1 seeds. Although nuclear divisions  take place more slowly in mea-1 endosperm,  the distribution of endosperm nuclei  is as in the wild type. Partial cellularization  occurs at the micropyle when mea-1  embryos reach the late heart stage in desiccating  seeds, but because fewer nuclei have  been generated, most of the central cell is  devoid of nuclei. Thus, in mea-1 seeds, the  development of both fertilization products  is delayed but morphogenesis proceeds normally,  and it appears that the embryo shows  increased cell proliferation at the expense  of the endosperm. . The homozygous progeny is embryo-lethal. Mutant homozygous mea embryo  sacs accumulated 45 times more maternal transcripts  than wild-type before fertilization,  and it persisted after fertilization (7.5 times more transcripts  4 d after pollination. .

Mutant plants showed alterations in the cuticular wax profiles and embryo development. Compared to wild type, the wax on inflorescence stems in mutants is reduced nearly 60% in total amount, has a proportional reduction in aldehydes and aldehyde metabolites, and has a proportional increase in acids, primary alcohols, and esters. Also, the C29 alkanes in mutants are nearly 6-fold lower, and the C30 primary alcohols are 4-fold higher compared to the wild type. In contrast to stems, the wax on mutant leaves increased roughly 43% in amount relative to the wild type, with the major increase occurring in the C31 and C33 alkanes. Approximately 70% of mutant seeds are shrunken and nonviable, with these being randomly distributed within both inflorescence and silique. Viable mutant seeds are slightly larger than those of wild type. the proportions of these fatty acids are not significantly different from wild type. Shrunken seeds contain 34% of the fatty acids of wild-type seeds, with proportionally more palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, and less of the longer and more desaturated homologs. Histological analysis of aborted rst1 seeds revealed that embryo development terminates at the approximate heart-shaped stage, whereas viable rst1 and wild-type embryos develop similarly.

ADH activity is stronger in early-maturing mutant embryos than in wildtype. Both glucokinase (GK) and fructokinase (FK) activities are completely absent from mutant embryos throughout the maturation process. The pattern of G6PDH activity is not altered in the mutant compared to wildtype. only a slight delay in increase of AGPase activity is detected. The wri1 has seed-specific phenotype, characterized by the wrinkledness of the seed and a strong reduction in the accumulation of seed oil. No striking differences between the wild-type and mutant plants were observed, in particular with respect to the number of siliques or seeds, a factor that could affect seed filling. Furthermore, the number of siliques per plant as well as the number of seeds per silique were not altered in the wri1 mutants. Early morphogenesis of the embryo as observed by light microscopy was indistinguishable in the mutants and the wild type, however, during the seed-filling stage triacylglycerols accumulated at a much lower rate in the mutant, and the final amount of triacylglycerols in mature wri1 mutant seeds was reduced by approximately 80%. The fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols extracted from mature wild-type and homozygous wri1 mutant seeds were different. There were only subtle differences in the time courses of protein accumulation during seed development between the mutants and the wild type. It appears that young mutant seeds contain more protein, whereas mature mutant seeds contain slightly less than wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the amounts of soluble sugars, including Suc, Glc, and Fru, were elevated throughout development of wri1 mutant seeds. Mature mutant seeds contained approximately twice as much Suc. However, developing homozygous wri1 seeds were impaired in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols. pyruvate and acetate were incorporated at an increased rate. Because the activities of several glycolytic enzymes, in particular hexokinase and pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, are reduced in developing homozygous wri1 seeds, it is suggested that WRI1is involved in the developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during seed filling. Delayed embryo elongation. Reduced seed dry weight. 45-55% decrease in fatty acid content.	PO:0009009|PATO:0000051|PATO:0000460	Plant PhenomeNET|TAIR

Epidermal pavement cells are strongly reduced in size. Increase in the frequency of trichomes with more stems. Leaf architecture is grossly disturbed. Many cells contain multiple nuclei and nuclear anomalies. Synergistic phenotype compared to both single mutants. Embryo defective, enlarged embryo cells and endosperm nuclei. Compared with wild-type trichomes, which normally are three-branched, the mutant has trichomes that are either two-branched or unbranched. Trichome stems and trichome branches are reduced in length, and the tips often are blunted. In leaf sections, mesophyll cells are frequently highly enlarged with one large nucleus. In some cases, the enlarged cells possesse incomplete cell walls and contain several nuclei. Male and female sterile. Male and female meiosis and/or early stages of gametophytic development are impaired. On the male side, the tetrad containing the four meiotic products seem to be normal initially, but before the release of the four microspores, nuclei appear to be fragmented. This phenotype is not fully penetrant. Approximately 5% of the released microspores are arrested at the binucleate stage, and 3% are arrested at the trinucleate stage, whereas the remaining microspores  have collapsed. A few microspores germinate  and form a pollen tube within the anther.  On the female side, ovule development started normally. However, at floral stage 12, when meiosis is completed in the wild type (Schneitz, 1995) and embryo sac development  has proceeded to the binucleate stage, the mutants still lack an embryo sac. No cell division defects are found in the root. Root cortical cells and epidermal hypocotyl cells of the mutant are indistinguishable from the wild type under normal growth conditions. . Whereas, under normal light conditions, wild-type and mutant hypocotyls are similar in length. However, in the dark, hypocotyl elongation is much reduced in the mutants compared with the wild type. Epidermal hypocotyl cells are bulged and short, indicating that they have lost growth polarity.	PO:0009009|PATO:0000051|PATO:0000460|PO:0025028|PATO:0000586|GO:0048353	Plant PhenomeNET|TAIR

Reciprocal crosses using the gametes from a clps3-1 heterozygote indicate that wild-type and clps3-1 pollen are equally efficient in fertilizing wild type plants. But, there is roughly a 50% reduction in transmission of the clps3-1 mutant female gametophyte. No embryo development can be observed in a presumed homozygote indicating lethality at a very early stage after fertilization. Expression of 35S:CLPS3:TAP rescues the embryo lethality phenotype.

Embryo lethal, embryos not viviparous, cotyledons partially transformed into leaves, complex vascular pattern observed in cotyledons. Embryos are sensitive to abscisic acid. Mutant seeds were usually desiccation tolerant at maturity, although their viability was reduced slightly after several weeks of storage. Dry seeds often germinated to produce seedlings with distorted cotyledons. This defect resulted from degeneration of cotyledon tips prior to germination. Some trichomes form on cotyledons after germination and stomata are found on surface of cotyledons of mutant embryos The cotyledon surface on seedlings produced from dry seeds lacked trichomes (likely because any trichomes initiated during embryogenesis did not survive desiccation). Mutant seeds were consequently highly pigmented at maturity and anthocyanins were especially prominent in the top half of the mutant cotyledons. Mutant embryos do not form roots during the first 48 hours of culture. The pattern of storage product accumulation was altered, the hypocotyl was filled with mature protein bodies, while the cotyledons exhibited a gradient of starch and protein accumulation. Cells in the top half of mutant cotyledons were highly vacuolated, packed with starch grains, and lacked mature protein bodies, whereas cells closer to the hypocotyl contained less starch but many protein bodies. The accumulation of lipid bodies during embryogenesis was unusual too: distribution of lipid bodies was highly abundant in the hypocotyls of the mutant plants. somatic embryogenesis  ability is very limited in lec2 mutants. strongly impaired ability to induce somatic embryos in vitro. Mutant seeds were not desiccation tolerant (unlike lec1), instead, 50-80% were desiccation intolerant, those that survived and germinated had cotyledons with trichomes on the adaxial surface. Embryos had abnormal suspensors, and precociously activated shoot apical meristem. Similar to tan-1 lec1-2, embryo arrested mostly at transition or heart stage.

Around 10 to 15% of developing seeds from a self-pollinated pcs1/+ plant were homozygous for the mutant allele, and all pcs1/pcs1 seeds were aborted at early stages. In developing embryos, there was no obvious differences between wt and pcs1 embryos before the heart stage. At the torpedo stage, however, pcs1 embryos underwent degeneration. Degenerated cells were apoptotic, which indicates that the pcs1 mutation causes excessive cell death of embryonic tissues.

In addition to the arrested embryo phenotype, aberrant cell divisions were also observed: These resulted in the formation of an elongated apical cell or embryo proper instead of the typical globular embryo in wild-type plants. A notable phenotype of the set09078 mutant is that ~19% of the mutant embryos displayed aberrant positioning of the division planes and asynchronous divisions. Furthermore, asynchronous divisions of the embryo proper and suspensor cells were observed. . In the homozygous mutant progeny, embryo development was arrested at the early globular stage. Although the normal embryos continued to develop, the arrested embryos subsequently became shriveled and finally degenerated. The mutant embryos never reached the heart stage but arrested by the early globular stage. Despite the aberrant embryo development phenotype, no developmental defect was observed during endosperm development in the mutant ovules. . Of the 269 mutant embryos examined, 6% were arrested at the 1-cell embryo stage, 19% were arrested at the 2- to 4-cell stage, 38% were arrested from the 6-cell to the 8-cell stage, and 18% were arrested at the 16-cell stage.

But, the quinolate synthase activity of the old5 mutant is not significantly different from the wild type level of activity, most likely because the QS domain is not the site of the mutation. Aspartate oxidase transcript levels are increased in the old5 mutant. And, NAD, NADH, NADP, and NADPH levels are also increased 27 days after germination. The activity of the NAD salvage pathway appears to be upregulated in this mutant. The level of several other metabolites, including those associated with the TCA cycle, are also altered in old5 mutants. The respiration rate of old5 is elevated compared to the respiration rate in wild type seedlings which leads to an increase in oxidative stress.

Double mutant enhances the SAM phenotype. 80% of double mutants show shoot termination after germination and production of the first two sets of leaves. Shoots regenerate at a low frequency. 30 from a total of 40 seedlings (75%) developed at least one leaf 8 days after germination and all double mutant progeny developed leaves by day 20. In 19 stm-1 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings, leaves initiated from the base of the cotyledons, which were always fused due to lack of early STM activity. In the remaining 21 double mutant progeny single leaves or side shoots arose laterally, from the outside of the fused base of the petioles instead of being initiated from the shoot apex and thus resembled stm-1 mutant side shoots which are initiated after a long delay. The double mutant progeny does not develop flowers. More than half of plants display early termination of main SAMs without rosette leaves. About 51% of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings produced leaves by 8 days after germination, compared to only 3% in the stm-5 single mutant. In contrast to combination with stm-1, leaves of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutants never initiated from outside the base of the cotyledon petioles but emerged internally to the cotyledons where the SAM normally resides in wild type. .

Hypocotyl explants of the rpd1-1 mutant formed root-primordium-like structures after 16 days of culture at the restrictive temperature (28°C) on root-inducing medium, whereas at the permissive temperature (22°C), they formed normal adventitious roots. The inhibitory effect of the rpd1 mutations on adventitious root formation was detected at the primordial stage after six days of culture. Temperature-sensitive mutant. Initial root primordium formation in the mutant hypocotyl explants proceeded normally at the restrictive temperature (28°C) on root-inducing medium. after three days of culture, the root primordium was arrested or strongly retarded at the two- to four-cell-layer stages. Therefore, the mutation inhibited the development of adventitious root primordia beyond the two-cell-layer stage without affecting the earlier processes of primordium development, including the initiation of cell proliferation. This developmental arrest was reversible upon temperature shift from 28°C to 22°C, root primordial developed normally and formed lateral roots. Mutant hypocotyl explants were cultured on callus-inducing medium at 22°C or 28°C. During the first four days of culture, callus growth appeared not to be affected in the mutant hypocotyls, compared with that in the wild-type explants. After day 4, however, callus growth in the mutant explants was retarded severely at 28°C. temperature sensitive, impaired in adventitious root formation in hypocotyl. Similar to rpd1-1 mutation.

Reduced number of carpels relative to clv3 single mutant. trn2-23010 clv3-2 double mutant flowers also exhibited an additive phenotype not observed in single clv3-2 or trn2-23010 plants: double mutant flowers had reduced organ numbers in sepal, petal and stamen whorls, reminiscent of trn2-23010 single mutant flowers and in contrast to clv3-2 single mutant flowers, there was no increase in the number of stamens. However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers. .

These mutants have shorter hypocotyls than wild-type plants when grown in low R:FR ratio light. sav3-1 mutants are shorter and have reduced leaf hyponasty compared to wild type plants when both are subjected to supplementary far red light. Shade-induced expression of IAA19 and IAA29 is reduced in this mutant compared to wild-type plants. These mutants have shorter hypocotyls, shorter petioles, and more leaf area than wild-type plants when grown in low R:FR ratio light. They mutants have 60% of the free auxin normally found in wild-type mutants with a marked reduction in IAA synthesis rate under shade conditions. Microarray experiments indicate that following shade treatment, the sav3-2 mutant has 66 genes that are expressed at a lower level than in WT plants. Shade-induced expression of IAA19 and IAA29 is reduced in this mutant compared to wild-type plants, but the wild-type expression level can be restored with 1 uM IAA.

The hypocotyl of this mutant responds normally to ACC when grown in the dark, but, its roots are moderately less sensitive to ACC than wild type seedlings grown under the same conditions. This difference in sensitivity can be eliminated when the mutants are treated with ACC and low levels of IAA. wei8-1 and wild type hypocotyls and roots respond similarly to IAA in the absence of ACC. The roots of wei8-1 mutant seedlings do not display proper gravitropism. High-temperature mediated hypocotyl elongation is reduced by ~25% in these mutants compared to wild-type seedlings. These triple mutants do not make a primary root, they have an extremely reduced hypocotyl, and they lack discernible vasculature in their cotyledons. These mutants have a higher propensity to develop a single cotyledon than wild-type embryos. The roots of this mutant show almost no sensitivity to the ethylene precursor ACC, but sensitivity is largely restored by the addition of low levels of IAA (but not tryptophan). ACC-triggered dark-grown apical hook formation is also compromised in this mutant, and it is not restored by the addition of IAA. Root gravitropism is more disrupted in this double mutant than in either single mutant. The mutant plants are shorter than wild type, have reduced venation in their leaves, exhibit reduced apical dominance, and produce abnormal flowers. DR5:GUS expression is also diminished in these double mutants, consistent with a ~50% reduction in IAA levels in these mutants.

Short primary roots. Very little vascular tissue. Few radially symmetric organs with very little vascular tissue and no trichomes. Short primary and lateral roots. Root hairs form close to root apex. Phenotype enhanced at low temperature.  Double mutants were indistinguishable from bps1 single mutants. Growth of bps1-2 mutants on CPTA-supplemented medium resulted in partial rescue of both leaf and root defects. bps1-2 mutants grown on control growth medium have small radialized leaves with very little vascular tissue, and very short misshapen knotted-looking roots. By contrast, bps1-2 mutants grown on CPTA-supplemented medium produced larger flattened leaves that contained primary and secondary veins, and smooth elongated roots. Mutant roots were abnormal. primary and lateral roots were short, root hairs formed close to the root apex, and root defects were most severe when plants were grown at low temperature. Mutants produced two radially symmetric organs in the place of leaves. these organs were typically devoid of vascular tissue and lacked trichomes. Prolonged 16°C growth did not result in additional organs being produced, indicating that shoot meristem (SAM) activity was also lost. Mutants grown at 22°C showed a similar, albeit less severe, phenotype. The first leaf pair was slightly larger and flatter than those of 16°C-grown mutants and contained some vascular tissue, and additional radial organs were produced by the SAM. Mutants grown at 29°C showed an even less-severe phenotype. these plants produced flattened, irregularly shaped leaves with slightly lobed margins and an abnormal vein pattern. Under high light conditions (approximately 200 &mu.E.m-2.sec-1), CPTA-treated seedlings were completely photobleached and mutants showed rescue of both leaf and root development. Under moderate (approximately 100 &mu.E.m-2.sec-1) and low (30 &mu.E.m-2.sec-1) light intensities, seedlings are incompletely photobleached, but leaf and root development continue to show partial rescue. In double mutant seedlings grown on CPTA, a partial rescue of the bps1 phenotype was observed.

Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype. . bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems had a decreased ratio of adaxialized vascular phenotypes compared with kan1 kan2 stems. Similar to what was observed in petioles, 6.7% of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems exhibited an abaxialized phenotype of xylem surrounded by phloem, while others (13.3%) had both types of vasculature in a single stem. Cauline leaves of bop2 plants do not develop ectopic outgrowths from the basal region. Plants displayed defects in inflorescence  development. Plants frequently formed fused and/or fasciated inflorescences and generated multiple flowers from the same node.

Root length was reduced only by 46% compared to 90% in WT plants (Fig. 1B). The  germination rates on trehalose were identical to those on medium without trehalose indicating that the smaller roots are not caused by delayed or deficient germination. . The inhibition of root growth in WT plants by trehalose could be overcome by bypassing the need for starch breakdown through continuous light.

However, morphology and fertility of the flowers is relatively unaffected. Compact rosettes with shortened petioles and small leaf blades. Root elongation unaffected. Semi-dwarf phenotype. Strong cytokinin-insensitive phenotype. The hypocotyl length of the double mutant is slightly decreased. this effect is largely due to reduction in cell number rather than cell size.

The double mutant exhibits much stronger auxin-related phenotypes than those of the  single mutants. Adult double mutant plants have thin and short inflorescence stems, and their rosette leaves are small and epinastic. In addition, it has reduced numbers of inflorescence stems, suggesting enhanced apical dominance. By contrast, its flowers appear to be  normal, and they fertilize normally. The double mutant mutant displays agravitropic responses in both hypocotyls and roots. When seedlings are grown vertically under dark conditions, the regulation of growth orientation is disrupted in both hypocotyls and roots, with the hypocotyls occasionally growing downward and the roots upward. Also, the roots and hypocotyls of the double mutant show reduced gravitropic curvatures compared with the wild type when vertically dark-grown seedlings are reoriented by 90°.

Homozygous mutants had poorly developed siliques with a few or no seeds, compared with heterozygous mutant or wild type siliques that were fully filled with seeds. Flowers on the homozygous sterile plants were often slightly smaller and open for considerably longer periods than wild type, and a majority of them (80 to 90%) remained unfertilized. Otherwise, mutant plants revealed only mild very morphological and developmental phenotypes. The anthers from the sterile plants were often smaller, more heart shaped, and contained fewer pollen grains compared with wild type anthers, which were somewhat oblong and fully filled with pollen In addition, the mutant pollen grains were slightly larger than wild type. Because the mutant stamens often had shorter filaments than the wild type self-pollination was seldom efficient. However, upon manual pollination, pollen from the homozygous mutant plants germinated on self or wild type stigmas and produced fertile seeds, indicating that the mutant pollen grains, although larger, were viable. When homozygous mutant plant was pollinated with wild type pollen, the cross-pollination resulted in near normal development of siliques and production of seeds suggesting that the female development was not affected by the arp4-1 mutation. Sterility in the homozygous mutant plants is the result of production of fewer pollen and inefficient self-pollination. Mutant plants had a 35 to 40% reduction in the amount of AtARP4 protein compared with wild type.

Slight increase in delay of flowering compared to agl24 single mutant. Frequently (70% of double mutant flowers) sepals were fused and they showed carpelloid features, including stigmatic papillae and multiple ovules developed along the margin of each organ. The double mutant has the same flowering time as the svp single mutant. Under standard growing conditions (22°C), only the first three flowers of the double mutant were affected. These flowers had a reduced number of organs. In particular, this reduction concerned the second and third floral whorls that produced three petals and five stamens, whereas wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana flowers have four petals and six stamens. Furthermore, some flowers showed homeotic conversion of sepals into petaloid organs. . When double mutant plants were grown at a higher temperature (>30°C), almost all flowers (90%) were severely affected in contrast with wild-type and single mutant plants that showed no floral phenotype. The double mutant flowers exhibited variable floral defects, and all produced a reduced number of organs. The triple mutant displayed proliferating inflorescence meristems in positions that would normally be occupied by flowers. This phenotype is very similar to the ap1-1 cal-1 double mutant phenotype. However, the mutant formed a few flower meristems that produced  stamens and carpels. The triple mutant also showed increased levels of the FUL mRNA in the inflorescences  when compared with wild-type (five-fold) and the ap1-1 cal double mutant (two-fold). Unlike the agl24-2 svp-41 double mutant, where severe phenotypes similar to the lug mutant were only observed when plants were grown at 30°C, in the ap1-12 agl24-2 svp-41 triple mutant, severe lug-type phenotypes were observed under normal growing conditions (22°C). .

In the hypocotyl of light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, chloroplasts are well developed. The morphology and distribution of chloroplasts of the mutant is indistinguishable from those of wild type only at the upper part of the hypocotyl. However, a reduced number of chloroplasts, which are pale green, are observed at the middle part of the mutant. In the lower part of the hypocotyl, the number of chloroplasts is reduced in wild-type plants. however, the  mutant showed only a few small and  transparent plastids. . Mutants grown on agar plates have widely  spread lateral roots. Compared with that of wild-type plants, the direction of lateral root growth is nearly horizontal rather than downward, indicating alteration of the gravitropic response. The angles between the lateral roots and the orientation of gravity are larger than those of the wild type. In addition, secondary lateral roots grow and change their direction of elongation to the horizontal. Roots of wild-type plants turn green when grown under light conditions.  The roots of wildtype plants were green, whereas those of the mutants remained white after having been  cultured for 30 days under light. The chlorophyll content in roots of the wild-type plant (Ws) was 1.1 &#956.g of chlorophyll/gram of fresh roots. Chlorophyll was not detected in roots of hy5-1 or hy5-Ks50.

Following <i>Pythium irregulare</i> infection, jasmonic acid levels were dramatically increased in ein2-5 mutants than in wild-type plants. Following <i>Pythium irregulare</i> infection, salicylic acid levels increased over wild-type levels. In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the leaves of ein2-5 plants started bleaching after 4 days of treatment. The leaf growth of the ein2-5 plants was dramatically inhibited by 400 mM mannitol although remained green, the wild-type plants, by contrast, stayed green and continued to grow. . Increased number of lateral roots. Reduced acropetal auxin transport. Root growth inhibition by ABA on ein2-5 seedlings increased when the concentrations of ABA were elevated. At the ABA concentrations (0.1-0.25 &#956.M) which stimulate root growth of wild-type plants, root inhibition of the ein2-5  plants started to be observed, and the most profound inhibitory effect was observed at 0.25 &#956.M and higher concentrations of ABA. Roots of the ein2-5 mutant seedlings showed enhanced sensitivity, although to a lesser extent, to salt and mannitol compared with the wild-type seedlings over the same period. Roots of ein2-5 seedlings were longer than those of the wild type in the absence of salt and osmotic stress condition. . Seedling growth, including cotyledon greening and expansion, was more sensitive to osmotic stress conditions. Severe inhibition in seedling growth was observed when NaCl and mannitol concentrations were 150 mM and 400 mM or higher, respectively. The cotyledons of the germinated ein2-5 seedlings did not expand and were yellow in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and 400 mM mannitol by 10 days after stratification under light. . Significantly increased susceptibility to the oomycete <i>Pythium irregulare</i>. The germination of mutant seeds was markedly  inhibited by both salt (NaCl) and osmotic stress (mannitol). The inhibition  of germination of the mutant was observed at as low a concentration as 50 mM NaCl, at which concentration the wild-type seeds hardly showed any inhibition in germination.  As the concentrations of NaCl in the media increased, the negative effect of the mutation became more evident. On the high salt medium (greater than or equal to 150 mM NaCl), germination of ein2-5 mutant seeds was inhibited to a greater extent than the wild-type seeds. Likewise, in the medium containing mannitol, the ein2-5 mutant seeds showed similar kinetics in germination. Within a four-day  period, ein2-5 seeds had more than a 30% reduction in germination in the presence of 500 mM mannitol. When the mutant was grown on increasing concentrations of ABA, cotyledon greening of ein2-5 seedlings was inhibited dramatically, and the inhibitory effects were increased in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction in percentage of cotyledons turning green of ein2-5 seedlings was more than 10% at as low as 0.1 &mu.M ABA. At 0.5 &mu.M ABA, only about 20% of ein2-5 germinated seedlings turned green while 100% of wild-type seedlings were green at 10 days in light. The root elongation of ein2-5 seedlings was also supersensitive to ABA. . Compared with the parent ein2 and EIN3ox plants, etiolated EIN3ox ein2 seedlings exhibited an intermediate phenotype in terms of hypocotyl and root lengths. A reduced EIN3 protein levels were detected in EIN3ox ein2-5 progeny compared with that of EIN3ox parent plants. The EIN3ox ein2 and five seo seedlings were completely unresponsive to ethylene application, similar to ein2. In addition, treatment with ACC failed to enhance the accumulation of EIN3 protein in EIN3ox ein2-5. The expression levels of ERF1 and EBF2 were not further increased by ethylene in the EIN3ox ein2 plant. By contrast, ethylene application enhanced EIN3 protein accumulation and ERF1 and EBF2 gene expression in the EIN3ox plants.

An increased extent of sepal fusion in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double mutant as compared with cuc2-1 was first observed during stage 6. In double mutant flowers, sepal fusion occurred more often and to a greater extent than in either single mutant. . Absence of leaf serrations, smooth leaf margins.

Small leaves. Sterile anthers. Low penetrance of increased cotyledon number. Abnormal cotyledon shape. Dwarf. Small, lanceolate leaves. Short, sterile anthers. Severely reduced fertility. Reduced vascularization.  Double mutants display a phenotype that was not observed in the parental lines or in the single mutants. In seedlings, double mutants show alterations of cotyledon shape, such as fused cotyledons and the impairment of leaf and shoot growth and differentiation. In 2-week-old adult plants, the rosette diameter of these mutants was reduced at least 10-fold. Only the primary vascular strand but no secondary or tertiary strands differentiated. Inability to form normal leaf blades. Adult homozygous tgh mutant plants have a reduced stature and significantly smaller lanceolate leaves. Anthers failed to elongate and produce pollen. Almost complete infertility. At the seedling stage, tgh mutant seedlings are recognizable by developmental defects, including triple cotyledons, altered cotyledon shape, and reduced elongation growth in dark-grown seedlings. The triple cotyledon phenotype is,  however, not fully penetrant (e.g., only 7 of 362 progeny seedlings of a TGH/tgh-1 parent line displayed the triple cotyledon phenotype corresponding to a penetrance of 7.7%). tgh mutants have an imperfect vascular system  with differentiated but frequently unconnected vascular strands, which is cuased by a defect in the initiation of vascular development.

Temperature-sensitive mutant characterized by shortening and loss of ordered alignment of cortical microtubules at temperatures above 28C. Microtubule organization is rapidly reversed at 21C. No visible phenotype is observed if the mutant is grown at the permissive temperature. At the restrictive temperature, the mutant plants are severely stunted, with radially swollen and short organs, show left-handed twisting of upper parts of roots and do not produce flowers. Stronger phenotype than gem1-1. Defects in cell division - particularly in the pollen which leads reduced transmission through pollen in heterozygotes. Sporphytic lethal as homozygote. Cortical microtubule disorganization commonly found in elongating cells in mutant seedlings, however, disruption of mitotic and cytokinetic microtubule arrays was not detected in all dividing cells. Nevertheless, quantitative analysis identified distinct defects in preprophase bands (PPBs), spindles, and phragmoplasts. In nearly one-half of dividing cells at the restrictive temperature of 30 degrees C, PPBs were not detected prior to spindle formation, and those that did form were often disrupted. mor1-1 spindles and phragmoplasts were short and abnormally organized and persisted for longer times than in wild-type cells. Microtubule organizational defects led to aberrant chromosomal arrangements, misaligned or incomplete cell plates, and multinucleate cells. Temperature-sensitive mutants. Mutation causes temperature-dependant microtubule disruption causing cortical microtubules to shorten and lose ordered alignment at temperatures above 28 degrees C. Recovery of normal microtubule organization after returning to the permissive temperature was rapid. When grown at permissive temperature mutant plants and wild type cannot be distinguished. At the restrictive temp, mutant plants were extremely squat and didn't develop flowers, and eventually die. Several morphological defects were observed, such as impaired root hair polarity, isotropic cell expansion, left-hand twisting of organs. Throughout development (at any stage), mutant plants exhibited altered morphology and function at the restrictive temperature.

High accumulation of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in flowers, causing a concentration-dependent defect in pollen tube growth, guidance and fertility. flowers on secondary inflorescences accumulate less GABA than those on primary branches and exhibit a corresponding increase in fertility. GABA concentrations increase along the pollen tube path, causing aberrant pollen tube growth and infertility. self-sterile, male gametophytic and female sporophytic defects. Hypersensitivity to NaCl and LiCl but not to mannitol in root growth assays. Under NaCl stress, pop2-1 mutant did not overaccumulate Na+ and Cl- but showed a slight decrease in K+ content. Additionally, mutant roots exhibited substantial metabolic changes upon salt stress, including overaccumulation of amino acids and decrease in carbohydrates content. Pollen tube growth defects in vivo. Primary root and dark-grown hypocotyl growth inhibition, at least in part due to cell elongation defects, upon exogenous GABA exposure. Increased accumulation of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in flowers (but lower levels compared to pop2-1) causing a concentration-dependent defect in pollen tube growth, guidance and fertility. GABA concentrations increase along the pollen tube path, causing aberrant pollen tube growth and infertility. partially sterile. Primary root and dark-grown hypocotyl growth inhibition, at least in part due to cell elongation defects, upon exogenous GABA exposure. Reduced plant growth when grown on media containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as the nitrogen source. The her1-1 mutant shows a specific resistance to E-2-hexenal-mediated root growth inhibition. her1-1 mutants have reduced apical dominance, but this phenotype is not observed in allelic pop2-1 (Ler) or pop2-3 (Ws) mutants indicating that this may be an ecotype-specific phenotype. her1-1 mutants produce fewer seeds and have higher levels of GABA than wild type plants. They are slightly more sensitive to E-2-pentenal and slightly less sensitive to E-2-heptenal than wild type seedlings in root elongation assays, but the reduced E-2-hexenal sensitivity is much more dramatic. her1 mutants, like wild type seedlings, produce higher GABA levels upon exposure to E-2-hexenal. The her1-1 mutation does not appear to affect the plant's ability to degrade E-2-hexenal or to attach glutathione to it.

Homozygous cdc2a-1 mutants are lethal if germinated on soil. If grown on MS plates or in liquid medium (0.5 MS 1% sucrose), homozygous cdc2a-1 is sterile and severely affected, reaching a size of several mm in diameter in weeks. Defect during second mitotic division of pollen development results in pollen with a single generative and vegetative cell. Fertilization by pollen from heterozygous cdc2a mutant plants causes seed abortion. Cell cycle hypomorph exhibiting diminished CDKA.1 activity with a compromised ability to bind substrates. Approximately one quarter of seeds in siliques will contain small embryos with fewer but enlarged cells and cotyledons that do not, or only partially, fold to one side. Homozygous mutants are entirely female- and male-sterile. Homozygous are lethal. In self-fertilized heterozygous, severe seed defects were observed  in the mature siliques, whereas no obvious defect was observed before the reproductive stage. The mature siliques contain normal and  aborted seeds at a 1:1 ratio.  Male gametophytic lethal. Microspores normally undergo an  asymmetric cell division, pollen mitosis I (PMI), to produce bicellular pollen grains. The larger vegetative cell  does not divide, but the smaller generative cell undergoes mitosis, PMII, to form the two sperm cells, thereby  generating tricellular pollen grains.

Morphology and branching number of coi1-1 trichomes are normal. coi1-1 does not increase trichome density in response to wounding or methyl jasmonate treatment. Erysiphe cichoracearum spores had germinated by day 1, but conidiophores did not develop until 4 days post infection. After 6 dpi, many individual colonies had merged. therefore, further analysis was unfeasible. The numbers of conidiophores in colonies on coi1-16 plants increased faster than on wild-type plants. Following <i>Pythium irregulare</i> infection, salicylic acid levels increased over wild-type levels. Following <i>Pythium irregulare</i> infection, the increase in JA levels was lower in sid2-1 plants than in wild type. This mutant has responses to JA similar to coi1-1, except that it displays temperature-sensitive fertility and can be maintained as a pure breeding line.

Homozygous embryos have proportionally thicker hypocotyls and smaller cotyledons. However, the general organization of the tissues in the embryonic axis, such as procambial strands, ground tissue, and protodermis, was indistinguishable from that of wild-type embryos described in the literature. . Homozygous embryos produce very low levels of chlorophyll. Homozygous embryos were reduced in size compared with wild-type embryos, and their cotyledons were smaller, with irregular borders, pointed tips, and uneven sizes. . Homozygous mutant embryos develop more slowly compared with wild-type embryos during the later stages of development. Abnormal morphology starts to be evident only after the heart stage. . Homozygous mutant seeds can germinate in vitro on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt plus 1% sucrose, although the  growth/developmental rate of the homozygous seedlings was slower compared with that of wild-type seedlings. Whereas wild-type seedlings displayed fully expanded green cotyledons, true leaves and a well-developed root system by 14 d after germination, homozygous seedlings were much smaller and white or pale green in color. Underdeveloped cotyledons emerged from the homozygous seeds but expanded very slowly and sometimes showed bumpy irregular surfaces and occasional anthocyanin expression. Partial greening was observed in ise2 seedlings only after culture for several weeks. Most of the homozygous seedlings developed leaf-like structures that were translucent and contained trichomes. The aerial portions of the homozygous seedlings generally were stunted and thicker and frequently exhibited callus-like structures after extended periods of culture. Mutant seedlings often form stunted inflorescence shoot- and flower-like organs but normal-looking roots and root hairs. Frequently, multiple short shoots originate from the apical dome of a single original seedling, forming a broccoli-like structure. Homozygous seedlings grown in culture with 1% sucrose are sterile and perish immediately after germinating in soil or on MS medium without sucrose. In all homozygous embryos from late-heart to late-torpedo stages, 15% of their plasmodesmata (PD) exhibited branched morphology, in contrast with the single simple PD observed in wild-type embryos. Branched PD were randomly distributed throughout the whole body of embryos, and no variation in their frequency was observed among late-heart, early-torpedo, and late-torpedo stages. . Mutation is lethal in the homozygous state. Radicle and the shoot apical meristem (SAM) appeared normal in the homozygous seedlings but were often larger. Wild-type and ISE2/ise2 heterozygous embryos remain green as their organs, such as hypocotyls and cotyledons, develop. The corresponding ise2 embryos (from the same silique) were white by light microscopy and never turned green even at later stages.

Stomatal aperture not affected by treatment with sodium nitroprusside (SNP). rif1-2 mutants are pale green with delayed leaf development. They are resistant to fosmidomycin, an inhibitor of the isoprenoid biosynthetic enzyme DXR. sensitive to ozone (O3). rif1-1 mutants are pale green with delayed leaf development. They have a strong resistance to fosmidomycin (FSM), an inhibitor of the isoprenoid biosynthetic enzyme DXR. The reduced rate of degradation of DXS and DXR in rif1-1 mutants leads to a higher accumulation of these two MEP biosynthetic enzymes. Though RIF1 was originally believed to be an NO-synthase, treatment with an NO donor, does not rescue the DXR over-accumulation phenotype, implying that this is not an NO-dependent phenotype. There is a reduction in the level of the large subunit of Rubisco, and two other plastid-encoded proteins in the rif1-1 mutant, however, levels of the plastid-encoded ClpP1 protease are elevated in rif1-1 mutants, compared to wild type seedlings. A plastid-targeted YqeH-GFP construct can rescue the growth, pigmentation, and FSM-resistance phenotypes of rif1-1. YqeH is a GTPase implicated in ribosomal biogenesis in bacteria.

Reduced leaf size and narrow laminae. The lamina area of mature first and second mutant leaves was reduced to 55% of that of the wild type. The length:width ratio was significantly increased, reflecting a much stronger reduction in width than in length of the blade. The mutation also affected rosette growth, reducing fresh and dry weight at flowering by 40 and 39%, respectively. . The mutant primary roots grew much more slowly than those of the wild type. No differences between mutant and WT were seen regarding cellular organization or cell wall formation in the root apical meristem. However, a clear reduction in meristem size was detected. The root growth rate of the mutant was severely reduced and no acceleration of growth took place. The average mature cortex cell length was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced from 171 &mu.m in WT to 104 &mu.m in hub1-1, whereas the cell production per hour had decreased by 65%, from 1.26 in Ler to 0.44 in hub1-1. The number of palisade cells across mutant lamina was 44% that of those in wild type, resulting in narrow leaf shape of the mutant. In addition to reduced cell numbers, distribution and size of the mesophyll cells were irregular with some enlarged cells and the air spaces were increased. The stomatal index was consistently reduced in all hub1-1 when compared with Ler samples, suggesting that a proportion of leaf epidermal cells of hub1-1 exit the mitotic cell cycle early. The stomatal index (i.e., the fraction of epidermal cells that are guard cells) increased more slowly in hub1-1 than in Ler between 5 and 8 DAS, with final values of 0.23 and 0.35 on average for hub1-1 and Ler, respectively. As a result, in mature leaves of hub1-1, fewer stomata were present, a difference that originated at the same time when division rates were changed. Pleiotropic phenotypes, such as pale-green leaf color, increased bushy appearance, and more open flower buds. Reduced seed dormancy phenotype. Reduced seed longevity. The chlorophyll content index in the mutant is lower than in wild type. The growth of hub1-2 seedlings on medium without sucrose is severely delayed compared with wild-type seedlings. Addition of 1.5% sucrose to the medium can rescue the delayed development of hub1-2, suggesting a defect in seedling establishment. Mutant growth was defective compared with  that of wild type. The mutants were reduced in size and had pale-green laminas with an  irregular blade surface and thinner inflorescence stems, but root growth was not  visibly reduced. Furthermore, the fresh weight of mutant was approximately half of that of wild type. Slightly reduced seed dormancy compared with wild-type seeds. The chlorophyll content index of the double mutant did not differ from the single mutants, and the germination percentage of freshly harvested seeds was slightly higher than that of the single mutants. Increased susceptibility to fungal pathogens B. cinerea and A. brassicicola. Early flowering when grown under 12 hour light regime. Reduced thickness of the cell walls. No new leaf and flower phenotypes were observed compared to the single mutant parents, and the biomass of the double mutant lines fell statistically in the same group as that of both single parents. Reduced leaf size. Leaf shape resembles that of spt16-1 single mutant. Earlier flowering than either single mutant.

The relative amounts of the PSII core subunits CP47, CP43, D1, and D2 is greatly reduced in the mutant, especially the PSII dimer. Wild-type chloroplasts are larger than those of the mutant and have a larger number of discs per grana stack on average.

This phenotype was more pronounced in older than in younger leaves. Mesophyll cell chloroplasts in wild type and mutant plants also differed ultrastructurally. In mutants, grana lamellae were less uniform in length and stacked in a staggered fashion, giving rise to a disorganized thylakoid array. Stroma thylakoids appeared less abundant than in wild type chloroplasts. In contrast, stroma thylakoids in mutants were similar in length to those in wild type but constituted a smaller proportion of the total thylakoid network.

At the reproductive stage, the mutants exhibit severe developmental defects that result in dwarf stature and the loss of apical dominance (52 DAG). At the vegetative stage, the csn5a plantlets are characterized by small, light green, and curly rosettes (12 and 14DAG), which are almost completely depleted of trichomes, in contrast with wild-type. Mutants are not lethal at the seedling stage, and, at a few DAG, the purple cotyledons turn light green before the production of true  leaves. Seedlings have purple cotyledons. Shorter hypocotyls in the dark, shorter  roots, smaller flowers, a decreased number of root hairs in response to jasmonic acid treatment, and altered light and auxin  responses. The cellular pools of the COP9 signalosome complex subunits: CSN1, CSN3, CSN5, CSN6, CSN7,  and CSN8, are reduced drastically compared with those in wild type. csn5a-1 and csn5a-2 are virtually indistinguishable from each other in the initial few DAG, starting from 8 DAG and throughout the vegetative stage, the phenotype of csn5a-2 is less severe than that of csn5a-1, in terms of both rosette size and trichome density. This difference becomes particularly evident at the reproductive phase (52 DAG). Double null homozygous mutant progeny invariably die at the seedling stage, do not express detectable CSN5 proteins, and are virtually identical to the null alleles of the cop/det/fus mutants. During the first two to three DAG, the double homozygous mutant progeny display the typical  photomorphogenic phenotype of the fusca mutants. In double homozygous progeny, significant reduction of CSN1, CSN6, CSN7, and CSN8 and in a very slight  reduction of CSN4. In the case of CSN3, the complete loss of function of CSN5 results in the accumulation of a larger and possibly modified CSN3 form, whereas the normal (smaller) CSN3 form is present predominantly in wild type. In the homozygous progeny, anthocyanin accumulation (purple coloration) in the cotelydons of developing embryos. Mutation is lethal in the homozygous state. A residual derubylation activity can be observed in the double mutant seedlings. At 6 to 7 DAG, the double mutants uniformly start to form the first pair of true leaves and eventually develop into impaired small plantlets, with dark red cotyledons and asymmetrical leaves. None of the double mutants arrest at the seedling stage, and even though severely compromised, mutant plantlets survive to a mature stage. . Synergistic phenotype: de-etiolated, fusca seedlings. Dark grown plants undergo photomorphogenesis. hypocotyl elongation ,cotyledon expansion, anthocyanin accumulation in cotyledons. Mutants are virtually indistinguishable  from wild-type siblings in the dark and in all light conditions, both at seedling and mature stages.

Reduced basipetal auxin transport in roots (~35%) and a small decrease in shoot-to-root transport consistent with a partial loss of the redirective auxin sink in the root. Although mutant seedlings display normal acropetal auxin transport in the root, basipetal auxin transport is reduced by about 50%. Root waving proceeds normally in the mutant seedlings, but gravitropic curvature is enhanced, occurring more quickly and to a greater degree than in wild type seedlings. mdr4-1 mutants display normal root architecture and have wild type rates of lateral root elongation. mdr4-2 mutants display normal root architecture and have wild type rates of lateral root elongation. The root lengths of 10-d pgp4 seedlings were 30% shorter than those of the wild type, and the number of lateral roots was also significantly reduced under moderate light levels (100 to 120 mmolm2s1) using sucrose concentrations of 0.5 to 1%. Under high light or on sucrose concentrations >1.5%, the root lengths and number of lateral roots observed were greater than or equal to those of the wild type.

But, whereas tert mutants show no visible growth defects through the G6 generation, atm/tert mutants in G5 show severe growth defects, such as aberrant leaf shape, delayed flowering, a loss of apical dominance, and reduced fertility. atm/tert mutants in G5 have a much higher rate of bridged chromosomes than G5 tert mutants. atm tert mutants undergo Telomere Rapid Deletion (TRD) events, that can lead to the production of a chromosome with a very short telomere. Just one of these structures can  prompt end-to-end chromosomal fusion events in the G5 generation. The anaphase bridges apparent in these atm/tert mutants seem to involve only a single chromosome in each distinct mutant line, and seem to occur between sister chromatids. These plants exhibit the same overall level of aneuploidy in the G5 generation as tert mutants do in the G6 generation (~52% of cells showing abnormal centromeric signals in interphase). atm/tert mutants are not as likely to undergo ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent process) as tert mutants, implicating ATM in this process. Fertility reduced to 0.9 (±1.9. n=317 siliques) seeds per silique. Double mutants are defective in telomere maintainance. Mutants form anaphase bridges.

1724	ath	At3g57670|NTT|AT3G57670		Reduced fertility.  Both fruit length and seed set are reduced in the mutant. Mature fruit are approximately  30% shorter than wild-type and the number of fertilized seeds is reduced by 60%. In mature wild-type fruit, stage 17, breakdown of cells within the transmitting tract has been completed and the mature two-cell layered septum has formed. In ntt mutants, cellular breakdown has not occurred, leaving several layers of cells between the two epidermal walls. In the mutant, pollen tubes have considerable difficulty growing within the transmitting tract, causing them to terminate travel prematurely and frequently to leave the transmitting tract. In wildtype, 62% of the seeds were found in the bottom half of the silique (50-100 percentile) and 5% were found in the apical region (0-20 percentile). On average, seeds formed toward the center of the silique (50?60 percentile). No preference was observed for fertilization of the  most apical ovules. In the ntt mutant, most seed formed in the upper half of the carpel (90%). Only female reproductive tissue is affected in the mutant, as shown by the fact that mutant pollen produces a normal seed set when applied to wild-type flowers. Considerably more siliques  are produced in the mutants, probably because of the reduced fertility of individual flowers. Pollen-tube growth in ntt mutants is essentially unaffected prior to entry into the ovary chamber. The first difference between the wild-type and ntt mutant  was observed 4 hr after pollination. Pollen tubes in wild-type had traveled a substantial distance into the transmitting tract, but in ntt mutants, tubes had only slightly penetrated the ovary chamber. In wild-type carpels, the first pollen tubes reach the  base of the ovary after 10 hr, whereas in ntt carpels, pollen tubes made little additional progress. Even after 48 hr, pollen tubes in the ntt mutant had penetrated only approximately a third of the way into the ovary chamber. Seeds develop only in the apical part of the fruit and are larger than those of wild type. Significant reduction in the number of pollen tubes for the mutant compared with wild type. Rootless phenotype. nww mutant embryos diverge from normal development at 32 cell stage. The  hypophysis asymmetric division fails resulting in loss of lens shaped cell.

Early prophase I from leptotene through to pachytene was indistinguishable from wild type, but as the chromosomes desynapsed towards the end of prophase I and began to condense during late diplotene/diakinesis, a proportion of the homologous chromosome pairs lack chiasmata and are present as univalents at metaphase  I. This resulted in missegregation at the first meiotic division, leading to the   formation of dyads containing aberrant chromosome numbers.

The morphological development of abi3-3 embryos does not appear to differ from wild-type, and if imbibed 10 DAF the seeds germinate to produce normal looking plantlets. However, if the embryos are left to desiccate they do not germinate. It appears that AB13 gene product is not essential for morphogenetic development of the embryo, but is required for protection of the embryo prior to desiccation. Impaired degreening during seed maturation - embryos were green throughout seed development and seeds are green at maturity and first true leaves were already formed at this stage. Embryo at maturity had fewer protein bodies, instead, large vacuoles were observed in cotyledons. Freshly harvested seeds germinated on wet filter paper within 2-3 days.

Mutant plants are more sensitive to salt stress at later stages of development and are killed by prolonged exposure to 100 mM NaCl or 200 mM mannitol, whereas wild type plants survive. Seeds are more tolerant of osmotic stress at germination than wild type seedlings. In contrast to wild type, ABA levels did not increased rapidly after infection with the oomycete <i>Pythium irregulare</i>. Increased susceptibility to <i>P. irregulare</i> compared with the wild type. Phenotype not described. Adult plants wilt under dessicating conditions. After bolting, the wilty phenotype became evident in the shoot apex, cauline leaves and immature siliques of this mutant. This phenotype was partially restored by application of 10 &mu.M ABA to rosette leaves. Approximately 40% of mutant seeds germinate after far red/red light treatment, whereas wild type germination was suppressed almost entirely. Endogenous ABA levels in fresh and dehydrated tissues of the mutant were about 23% and 2.4%, respectively, of those of the wild type plants. . Endogenous levels of 12 amino acids were at least 2-fold greater in wild-type than in the mutant plants after 18 h dehydration. Amino acids that exhibited marked increases were leucine (152-fold), isoleucine (95-fold), proline (83-fold) and valine (25-fold). Aspartic acid was the only amino acid which showed a significant reduction in wild-type plants during dehydration. In dehydrated tissues of the mutant, 9 amino acids increased more than 2-fold during dehydration, however the increases in the mutant plants were less pronounced than those in wild-type plants. Glycine and alanine showed greater increases in comparison to wild type, whereas the levels of glutamic acid and aspartic acid showed a reduction in the mutant during dehydration. . Free amino acid levels in fresh tissues of the mutant plants at 30 DAI were similar to those in wild type, however the level of proline in the mutant plants was 4-fold higher than that in wild type. Germination of the mutant seeds after irradiation with far red light is inhibited by paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis. Mutant showed a similar sensitivity to 25 mM trehalose as wild type (inhibition of root growth). Seeds have a reduced dormancy. Several GA biosynthesis genes are upregulated in the mutant compared to wild type during seed development. The mutant embryos are morphologically normal, although mature embryos are more yellow compared to white wild-type embryos. The mutant has smaller rosette leaves and mature plants are not yellowish as has been reported for abal mutants. Under the reported growth conditions, approximately 10% of the dark germinated seedlings of the mutant produced true leaves. The dark germinated seedlings of the mutant did not show further growth even after a prolonged period of darkness.

The kyp-2 mutant has defects in callus formation under laboratory conditions. Many fewer seeds form calluses compared to wild type seeds, and the calluses that do form are delayed and smaller in size. kyp-2 mutants are defective in the process known as alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent process. These mutants also show a loss of association between K9-dimethylated H3 histones and telomeric and centromeric DNA via ChIP assays.

After bolting, the wilty phenotype became evident in the shoot apex, cauline leaves and immature siliques of this mutant. This phenotype was partially restored by application of 10 &mu.M ABA to rosette leaves. Approximately 40% of mutant seeds germinate after far red/red light treatment, whereas wild type germination was suppressed almost entirely. Endogenous ABA levels in fresh and dehydrated tissues of the mutant were about 23% and 2.4%, respectively, of those of the wild type plants. . Endogenous levels of 12 amino acids were at least 2-fold greater in wild-type than in the mutant plants after 18 h dehydration. Amino acids that exhibited marked increases were leucine (152-fold), isoleucine (95-fold), proline (83-fold) and valine (25-fold). Aspartic acid was the only amino acid which showed a significant reduction in wild-type plants during dehydration. In dehydrated tissues of the mutant, 9 amino acids increased more than 2-fold during dehydration, however the increases in the mutant plants were less pronounced than those in wild-type plants. Glycine and alanine showed greater increases in comparison to wild type, whereas the levels of glutamic acid and aspartic acid showed a reduction in the mutant during dehydration. . Free amino acid levels in fresh tissues of the mutant plants at 30 DAI were similar to those in wild type, however the level of proline in the mutant plants was 4-fold higher than that in wild type. Germination of the mutant seeds after irradiation with far red light is inhibited by paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis. Mutant showed a similar sensitivity to 25 mM trehalose as wild type (inhibition of root growth). Seeds have a reduced dormancy. Several GA biosynthesis genes are upregulated in the mutant compared to wild type during seed development. The mutant embryos are morphologically normal, although mature embryos are more yellow compared to white wild-type embryos. The mutant has smaller rosette leaves and mature plants are not yellowish as has been reported for abal mutants. Under the reported growth conditions, approximately 10% of the dark germinated seedlings of the mutant produced true leaves. The dark germinated seedlings of the mutant did not show further growth even after a prolonged period of darkness. No visible phenotype compared to Col-0/gl1 wild-type. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is slightly increased in the mutant. In contrast to the ku70 mutant, which undergo telomerase-dependent expansion to more than twice the normal length in a single generation, the ku70 tert double mutant displays accelerated telomere shortening and a precocious onset of genome stability. . Compared to wild type, no secondary thickening or lignification is seen in the anther  endothecium, although other tissues in the mutant plant undergo normal secondary thickening. As the anther dehydrates the endothecium layer distorts, shearing forces do not develop, and the anther fails to open. Male-sterile as a result of a failure of anther  dehiscence. reduced camalexin synthesis in response to infection. Same degree of telomere shortening as in the pot1 ku70 and ku70 tert double mutants. Telomeres in the double mutants shortened at the same rate as in either single mutant. . Telomeres of the same length and sharp banding profile were found in the double mutant, as in their tert and pot1-1 siblings. Decrease of macronutrients concentration in the MS salt formulation to 1/20X results in a substantial reduction in primary root growth. Mutant grown in greenhouse or growth chamber exhibits reduced shoot and root biomass relative to the wild-type. Mutant grown on Pi-deficient medium for 25 days accumulate more anthocyanins than wild-type. Substantially more pronounced prototypical Pi starvation root architecture responses than sos3-1 or wild-type seedlings. On Pi-limited medium, mutant seedlings exhibit an inhibition of primary root growth, an increase of lateral root development and length, and higher root/shoot fresh weight ratio than wild-type.  Enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000.  Smaller in stature.  Impaired drought tolerance. Suppression of NaCl sensitivity of sos3-1 seedlings. 50% of the mitotic nuclei in anaphase from tert mutants with severe growth defects (in the G8 generation) have anaphase bridges, while none are found in comparable wild type controls. These anaphase bridges occur disproportionately often between rDNA regions. A number of chromosomal defects can also be visualized during metaphase in these mutants. About 30% of the leaf mesophyll cells examined in tert G8 mutants have elevated numbers of nucleoli. Late generation, starting around G3,  tert mutants have decreased root meristem size and overall root length. This is correlated with decreased telomere length in successive generations suggesting maintenance of meristem activity is coupled to telomere length. No obvious phenotypic changes in the first (G1) or second (G2) generation. However, starting in G1, the telomeric smear in AtTERT-deficient plants was replaced by several sharp bands. By G2 at least 11 discrete telomeric fragments were visible. . urm23 enhances the hypomorphic gl1-2 allele and results in almost complete glabrousness (loss of trichomes) in normal growth condition. urm23 gl1-2 double mutant does not increase trichomes at all in response to wounding or methyl jasmonate treatment. urm23 is dominant in gl1-2 background. gl1-2 is incompletely dominant in urm23 background. urm9 enhances the hypomorphic gl1-2 allele and results in almost complete glabrousness (loss of trichomes) in normal growth condition. urm9 gl1-2 double mutant shows strong, but not complete, defect in wounding and jasmonate-induced increase of trichomes. GL3-GFP fusion protein is mis-localized in a subset of urm9 gl1-2 epidermal cell nuclei. urm9 is recessive in gl1-2 background. gl1-2 is incompletely dominant in urm9 background.

ABA inhibits stomatal opening in nia1 nia2 as in the wild type, revealing that not all stomatal responses to ABA are reduced. Guard cells do not generate NO in response to  H2O2 and are not significantly different to untreated controls. Nitrite fails to induce stomatal closure in epidermal peels of the double mutant. No emission of NO (nitric oxide) under condition in which wild-type does. Wounding-induced NO production is however still observed. Significantly impaired in NO biosynthesis in response to exogenous H2O2 compared to wild-type. Stomata are far less sensitive to ABA. Stomatal aperture not affected by treatment with sodium nitroprusside (SNP). double mutant. chlorate resistant (more resistant than the chl3-5 parent) due to very low levels of nitrate reductase activity, about 0.5 percent of level in Columbia. very poor growth on nitrate medium. Nitrate reductase (NR)-null mutant. no detectable NR activity and can not use nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. requires ammonia as nitrogen source.

1920	ath	At2g21170|cpTPI|AT2G21170		Seedling lethal.  This mutant has no visible phenotypic abnormalities. This mutant is severely stunted in growth. The seeds germinate at a rate comparable to wild type seeds but they begin to show aberrant phenotypes 3 to 4 days post-germination. Their cotyledons are paler and their primary roots are shorter than in wild type seedlings. The mutants have fewer chloroplasts per cell and the chloroplast differentiation seems to be delayed. They have fewer starch granules in their stroma. These mutants grow like wild type seedlings under dark-grown conditions. Light-grown pdtpi mutant tissue has roughly 40% less triose phosphate isomerase activity than comparable wild-type tissue. pdtpi seedlings also have elevated levels of glycerol, glycerol-3-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and reduced levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The level of methylglyoxal (MG) is doubled in mutant seedlings. Total lipid content is slightly reduced, but there are notable differences between various lipid components (e.g. MGDG vs. DGDG). Overall the changes in composition indicate an enhancement of the eukaryotic galactolipid biosynthesis pathway and a decrease in the prokaryotic pathway variant. DHAP and MG accumulation in the mutant may be responsible for many of the aberrant phenotypes.	PO:0000003|PATO:0000718|PO:0007131	Plant PhenomeNET|TAIR

Once they were transferred to the long day conditions (after being grown in constant light until they reached the rosette leaf stage and were ready to bolt), the mutant plants continued to grow similarly to wild type except that their growth was slightly reduced and their final height was ~80% of that of wild type. Under continuous light the mutant plants grew equally well compared to wild type and finally reached the same height.

The youngest part of the homozygous progeny are slightly green at the center of the seedlings. Null allele. Albino phenotype even in the youngest part of the seedling, which often accumulates anthocyanins. Seedlings grown in artificial media supplemented with sucrose are able to produce a few irregularly shaped leaves, followed by an arrest in growth. The timing of growth arrest varies from one seedling to the next leading to a variety of sizes and morphologies. Cotyledons in young homozygous progeny were red, most likely because chlorophyll was low or absent, and anthocyanin pigments accumulated. Dwarfed and chlorotic mutant plants. In the mutant's homozygous progeny, mature rosette leaves were retarded in growth. Secondary and tertiary veins in mutant leaves were thicker than in the wild type, and their diameter was commensurate with that of the primary vein. The organization of leaf mesophyll into palisade and spongy parenchyma cells was lost, and the leaf surface was extremely curled. This deformation in the mutant leaf was already visible in  cotyledons. In addition, leaf cross sections revealed that mesophyll cells, in contrast with wild-type plants, do not contain fully differentiated chloroplasts. . Plastids of cotyledons, leaves, and shoot apices in the mutant plants were characterized by the presence of electron-dense phytoferritin aggregates. Those clusters were not found in any chloroplasts of wild-type plants. Roots were smaller than in wild-type plants.  However, no significant phenotype in roots of mutants maintained on sucrose-supplemented medium was observed. The majority of the slowly growing homozygous mutant progeny produced almost transparent rosette leaves. however, in approximately one-third of the plants, the leaves appeared white. This subpopulation of mutants was even smaller and did not produce inflorescences. The shoot apex and the very young emerging  leaves of homozygous progeny were pale green and their leaves turned chlorotic while growing. After 6 weeks on sucrose-containing agar, surviving mutant plants were able to produce an inflorescence. again, the young sepals of the flower were pale green and became white subsequently. The style and developing silique of the flower of the homozygous progeny were pale green, whereas leaves and stem accumulated anthocyanin pigments.

Among the embryos derived from a tdt-1 heterozygote, 25% were clearly distinguishable by their misshapen cells (5 of 23). These embryos contained small dense cells in the SAM region. however, they were not organized into distinct layers and they did not appear as a dome. . Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. The homozygous progeny of these mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology. The homozygous progeny does not form flower buds. The homozygous progeny is seedling lethal, showed arrested postembryonic development including cotyledon expansion, development of vascular networks, root elongation, and shoot development. The mutant produced no leaves, short roots  with short and swollen root hairs, chlorotic cotyledons that accumulated anthocyanins around their margins, and a short and swollen hypocotyl. In addition, the cotyledon-hypocotyl  junction was extremely fragile, which caused cotyledons to frequently fall off, even with gentle handling. Vascular defects in tdt mutants were also similar to those of vcs-7 in that cotyledon secondary veins mostly failed to form  closed loops. Much greater leaf development in both vcs-1  and tdt MC4 when grown at 16°C, whereas growth at 22 and 29°C resulted in progressively more severe defects in leaf development. However, tdt MC4 showed less extensive leaf development than that shown by vcs-1. Although some details of the vcs and tdt phenotypes differed, the major phenotypic defects were similar. Produced leaf primordia. 3-day-old seedlings still showed disorganized cell layers and no leaf primordia. The vascular transition is a region where the root-like vascular organization of the lower hypocotyl shifts to a shoot-like vascular organization. In tdt-1 mutants, this region ranged from being devoid of detectable xylem to containing xylem but with poorly aligned veins. This defect showed incomplete penetrance, but it was most prevalent when seedlings were germinated at higher temperatures. Appears similar to the single mutants.

A severe reduction (~10-fold) of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. For example, alanine, asparagine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and malate levels rise while fumarate, gentiobiose, and ribose  levels decrease. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage.The mutant phenotype can be largely rescued by continuous supplementation with thiamin. thic1 mutants produce white leaves and die early unless they are grown with thiamine supplements.

Alterations in the ultrastructure  of chloroplasts, with a drastic reduction in the amount of  both appressed and unappressed thylakoid membranes. Reduced  accumulation of various LHCPs. . Chlorophyll levels in the mutant are dramatically reduced to ~20% of those of wild type. In contrast to chloroplasts in the leaves, wild-type and mutant root plastids do not differ significantly in appearance. The root plastids appear to be some type of immature plastid or proplastid, as they contain a rudimentary internal membrane structure. . Leaf cells from mutant plants were slightly smaller than wild-type leaf cells and contained fewer chloroplasts per cell. Chloroplasts in mutant plants were smaller and distended in shape, with a large reduction in thylakoid membrane content and little evidence of grana stacking. Mutant is extremely chlorotic and grows considerably more slowly than wild type (particularly on soil). Reduction in Fe(III) chelate reductase activity under ion-deficiency conditions. By contrast, under ion-sufficient conditions, this activity for the mutant was reproducibly higher than that of wild type seedlings. The average shoot weight of a 14-day-old mutant seedling is approximately half that of a 14-day-old wild-type seedling.	PO:0000003|PATO:0002251	Plant PhenomeNET|TAIR

Increased ploidy levels due to endoreduplication. Insensitive to brassinosteroids.  Various organs of this brassinolide-insensitive dwarf mutant, such as leaves and roots,  are only about 25% the size of wild-type organs. Their cells have smaller nuclei and reduced ploidy, based on analyses of 12-day old leaves. bin4-1 phenotypes are not altered in triptychon, rastafari, kaktus2, or glabra2 mutants. However, chromosome doubling induced by colchicine does lead to increased cell size. SPO11-3/RHL2/BIN5:GFP can still enter the nucleus in the bin4-1 mutant background. The transcript level of several DSB-inducible genes, such as PARP1 is higher in bin4-1 mutants, but these mutants do not show general defects in the maintenance of transcriptional gene silencing. Elevated levels of DSB-responsive transcripts in bin4-1 can be partially suppressed by atm or atr mutations. There is ectopic expression of the transcriptional CYCB1.1:GUS reporter in non-dividing cells in the bin4-1 mutant. However, the transcript levels of many other G2/M genes are not altered based on RT-PCR analysis. The bin4-2 mutant has a dwarf phenotype with reduced cell size and a reduction in the maximum amount of endoreduplication observed in leaf cells. Cotyledon cells from bin4-2 mutants have higher levels of double strand breaks than comparable wild-type cotyledon cells. Small plants, reduced cell size, decreased endoreduplication, reduced number of root hairs and abnormal development of columella cells of the seed coat.

The reduction of giant cells is strongest immediately following bolting and becomes less pronounced with age. edt1 mutant plants show enhanced drought tolerance due to overexpression of the HDG11 protein. edt1 mutants have a longer primary root with more lateral roots, and have a higher root biomass. They have larger epidermal cells and larger stomata, but a lower stomatal density. Nevertheless, they have higher levels of photosynthesis than WT seedlings. Mutant seedlings accumulate higher levels of ABA following PEG treatment, and show constitutively higher levels of Pro. Superoxide dismutase activity is also higher in edt1 mutants. Overexpression of HDG11 in tobacco also causes improved drought tolerance. More branched trichomes compared with the wild type. Obvious enhancement of the excess branching phenotype of the hdg11-1 trichome. Although ectopic overexpression of HDG11 confers increased drought tolerance, hdg11-2 mutants do not appear to be less drought tolerant than wild type plants. The hdg11-2 mutant has increased trichome branching. Although ectopic overexpression of HDG11 causes increased drought tolerance, there is no evidence for reduced drought tolerance in hdg11-2 hdg12 double mutants.

Homozygous cls8-1 plants had crinkled leaves that showed slight yellowing at 4C  (also apparent under normal growth conditions)  Germination and cotyledon development are indistinguishable from wild type (Columbia), however the first developing true leaves appear bleached. Subsequent leaves emerge curled and ?ruffled?, with bleached edges. The rosette leaves expand some become crinkled and show patches of white or pits on the surface. There is often a degree of asymmetry along the axis of the main vein, with one half of the leaf failing to fully expand. The bleaching is localized to the petiole and the base of the leaf, and extends along the edges of the leaf. As they continue to expand, the leaves become greener, although the crinkling remains. Following bolting, the  cauline leaves show similar characteristics to rosette leaves.  Flowers produced by cls8-1 plants can be asymmetrical and the petals crinkled in appearance.

The homozygous double mutants progeny were severely dwarfed and sterile. The leaves were dark green, indicating an increase in chloroplasts per leaf area of the mutants, which was probably due to the reduced cell size. Several double mutant plants were unable to bolt and only grew rosette leaves. The homozygous mutant progeny are severely  deformed and are smaller in size compared with the wild type, possibly reflecting a reduction in water transporting ability. The double mutants had significantly less xylose compared with the irx8 and irx9 single mutant plants. Whereas irx8 and irx9 contain ~40 to 50% xylose compared with the wild type, the double mutant contained only ~20% xylose compared with wild-type plants. . Collapsed xylem vessels in roots and stems, suggesting a decrease in xylem wall strength in the homozygous mutants. Homozygous progeny does not produce seeds and has to be propagated as segregants from heterozygous plants. Immunolabeling of stem and root sections using using monoclonal antibodies specific for glucuronoxylans revealed strong fluorescence signals in the walls of interfascicular fibers and xylem cells in wild-type Arabidopsis, but only weak signals were detected in the corresponding tissues of mutant plants. In the homozygous mutant cell wall, decrease of cellulose content (~25%) and notable reduction in xylose in stems and roots (>50%). In the homozygous mutant, stunted growth and smaller leaves, siliques, and flowers compared with the wild type. Although the leaf size was considerably smaller  than the wild-type leaf, the trichomes of the mutants were the same size. In the homozygous mutant, uneven distribution of cell wall deposition compared with the wild type. Additionally, the region that separates cells, consisting of residual primary cell walls, is wider and exhibits less contrast in the mutant compared with the WT. Mature xylem vessels were  deformed in the homozygous mutant. However, in contrast with irx1 mutants, these  mutants also exhibited deformations in initiating xylem cells (i.e. the protoxylem cells). In addition,  the irx8 mutants contain ~50% more xylem cells than wild-type stems at a comparable developmental stage. The wall thickness of interfascicular fibers and vessels in the stems of the mutants was decreased by ~60% compared with the wild type, which is most likely the cause of their reduced stem strength. Where in wild-type roots xylem files form a closely packed array of cell  files, leading to the regular occurrence of  tripartite cell corners between xylem cell files, the central cylinder of homozygous mutant roots was disorganized and  the xylem files did not form a closely packed array. As a  consequence, tripartite xylem cell  corners could not be detected in the mutant. Xylem cells are significantly smaller in the homozygous mutant compared with  the wild type. The cell walls surrounding the xylem vessels are also  severely reduced in thickness in the mutants. Although irx8 mutants have significantly reduced xylose levels and seem to be defective in the production of an oligosaccharide leader found on the reducing end of most xylan chains, their xylan chains seem to show the normal branching pattern found in wild type xylan chains. However, the glucuronic acid found in wild type xylan chains is largely replaced by methylglucuronic acid. irx8 mutants are capable of accumulating cellulose throughout development, but they have lower total cellulose levels than wild type plants at middle and late developmental stages.

The growth defects observed in ibm1-4 are exacerbated in a ddm1-1 mutant background ddm1-1has also been shown to cause BONSAI hypermethylation. Meanwhile, DNA methylation and developmental defects are suppressed in kyp (At5g13960) and cmt3 (At1g69770) mutant backgrounds. The ibm1-1 mutation causes hypermethylation of the BONSAI (At1g73177) locus in the first generation in which the mutant allele becomes homozygous. The BONSAI gene undergoes cytosine methylation, primarily associated with non-CG  sites in the ibm1-1 mutant, whereas there is almost no evidence of cytosine methylation at this locus in wild type seedlings.

At the flowering stage, the flowers of the homozygous progeny showed normal floral structures consisting of the four floral organs: sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. However, the mutant flowers contained no dehiscent anthers, whereas wild-type flowers developed dehiscent anthers with dispersed pollen grains.

The uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (GT3, UGT73F3) showed specificity for multiple sapogenins and functions in saponin biosynthesis.  Homozygous plants were retarded in growth relative to normal plants, whereas heterozygous plants did not show dwarfism.  Homozygous plants could flower and produce a few pods. The seeds did not show visible morphological changes but took an unusually long time to germinate (at least 3 weeks).  Roots in homozygous lines were very short and less branched compared with the wild type.  Leaf saponin levels did not differ between controls and mutants.  Levels of 5 different saponins were lower in mutant lines (approx. 3-fold) compared with controls, while only one saponin was higher in the mutants.  The large (10-fold) increase of 3-Glc-28-Ara-Rha-Xyl-medicagenic acid in UGT73F3 knockout lines suggests that the UDP-glucose pool is being diverted toward increased formation of non-C-28-glucosylated sapogenins.

The uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (GT3, UGT73F3) showed specificity for multiple sapogenins and functions in saponin biosynthesis.  Homozygous plants were retarded in growth relative to normal plants, whereas heterozygous plants did not show dwarfism.  Homozygous plants could flower and produce a few pods. The seeds did not show visible morphological changes but took an unusually long time to germinate (at least 3 weeks).  Roots in homozygous lines were very short and less branched compared with the wild type.  Leaf saponin levels did not differ between controls and mutants.  Levels of 5 different saponins in roots were lower in mutant lines (approx. 3-fold) compared with controls, while only one root saponin was higher in the mutants.

Epistatic to ASYMMETRIC1 with respect to leaf symmetry. 30 from a total of 40 seedlings (75%) developed at least one leaf 8 days after germination and all double mutant progeny developed leaves by day 20. In 19 stm-1 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings, leaves initiated from the base of the cotyledons, which were always fused due to lack of early STM activity. In the remaining 21 double mutant progeny single leaves or side shoots arose laterally, from the outside of the fused base of the petioles instead of being initiated from the shoot apex and thus resembled stm-1 mutant side shoots which are initiated after a long delay. The double mutant progeny does not develop flowers. About 51% of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings produced leaves by 8 days after germination, compared to only 3% in the stm-5 single mutant. In contrast to combination with stm-1, leaves of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutants never initiated from outside the base of the cotyledon petioles but emerged internally to the cotyledons where the SAM normally resides in wild type. . No obvious phenotype different from those of trn1-2 or trn2-4 was observed in double mutant. Enlarged apical dome, altered in shape  and often protruding (the mutant meristem therefore contains over 40% more cells.). Phenotypic differences from wild type development first became evident with the emergence of the first true leaves. All leaves were severely twisted and irregularly shaped and many lacked large parts of the leaf lamina. This twisting phenotype was not restricted to the vegetative phase but involved cauline leaves, the inflorescence stem and all floral whorls. . The architecture of mutant flowers was distorted and was accompanied by reduced numbers of floral organs in the outer 3 whorls. This effect was least pronounced in the whorl of sepals (3.2 as against 4 in wild type) but the number of petals was reduced to 2.4 (4 in wild type) and on average, mutant flowers had only 3.5 stamens compared to 6 in wild type. In contrast, all mutant flowers contained 2 carpels such as in wild type but in 52% of mutant flowers, both carpels remained unfused and ovules were exposed. . Unfused carpels did not form siliques later during development. In contrast, the remaining flowers with fused carpels developed siliques which were twisted and failed to fully elongate.  However, these siliques produced no fertile seeds and reciprocal crosses with wild type plants revealed nonfunctionality of both male and female reproductive organs. trn2-23010 clv3-2 double mutant flowers also exhibited an additive phenotype not observed in single clv3-2 or trn2-23010 plants: double mutant flowers had reduced organ numbers in sepal, petal and stamen whorls, reminiscent of trn2-23010 single mutant flowers and in contrast to clv3-2 single mutant flowers, there was no increase in the number of stamens. However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers. . Whereas carpels were completely absent in wus-1 flowers and only 1.6 stamens (compared to 6 in wild type) developed in the third floral whorl, all trn2-23010 wus-1 flowers developed 2 carpels, which in contrast to trn2-23010 single mutants were seldom open (33%) and more usually fused. Consistent with the increased number of stamens (4.2 on average) in the third floral whorl, the trn2 mutation may compensate for a premature consumption of stem cells in wus-1 flowers. In contrast, the number of sepals and petals in the outer perianth whorls in trn2-23010 wus-1 was closer in number to that of the trn2 mutant rather than to wus-1 single mutant flowers. .

Low penetrance of fasciated stems and inflorescences and stamens exhibiting carpel characteristics. Reduced fertility.  At the seedling stage, tso2-1 mutants were similar to the wild type, with normal roots, cotyledons, and young leaves. Abnormalities first appeared in the fifth rosette leaf and persisted in all subsequent leaves, floral  organs, and siliques. The abnormalities included white sectors in green organs, uneven thickness, rough surfaces, and irregular margins of leaves or floral organs. Stamens occasionally exhibited carpel characteristics indicating homeotic transformation. The rough and uneven sepals apparently resulted from abnormally enlarged  cells as well as cell clusters projecting above the epidermis. The white sectors appeared to result from an absence of chloroplasts in patches of mesophyll cells and the formation of large air spaces or tiny cells in subepidermal cell layers. Occasionally, tso2 mutants exhibited  fasciated stems on which a single SAM, a group of self-renewing cells at the shoot tip, was enlarged and split into multiple SAMs. Finally, tso2 mutants exhibited reduced fertility, with .29% aborted seeds. tso2-1 floral tissues were found to contain significantly reduced levels of all four dNTPs. tso2-1 exhibited slightly  increased sensitivity to UV-C light, but only at high UV-C light levels. tso2-1 rnr2a-1 seedlings  did not develop beyond the two- to four-leaf stage.

Homozygous rpn10-2 plants are infertile and have underdeveloped and completely sterile siliques. Both male and female gametes are defective. Reduced growth rate, later flowering time, extended life cycle, taller, larger, thicker, and more lanceolar and epinastic rosette and cauline leaves, larger anthers and pollen grains, reduced axillary inflorescences and increased accumulation of anthocyanin on the floral stem surface, increased floral organ size and abnormal floral organ numbers. The rpn10-1 mutant has elevated levels of ubiquitin conjugates but the RPN(1-186):ARP(exon2):NPTII protein is still detected in a 26S proteasome-enriched fraction. This mutant has a reduced germination rate, several growth abnormalities, increased rosette leaf senescence, a reduction in stamen number, increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, decreased sensitivity to cytokinin, and increased sensitivity to abscisic acid, sucrose, and salt. The rpn10-1 mutant has defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via the 26S proteasome, rendering it more sensitive to misfolded proteins that are degraded in a 26S-proteasome / Ub-dependent manner. However, it has increased levels of the 20S core particle of the proteasome, and exhibits reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress, presumably since oxidatively damaged proteins can be degraded in a 20S proteasome-dependent, but 26S proteasome /Ub-independent manner.

Dual phenotype, reduced chlorophyll content and gravicurvature-defective. Significant increase in anthocyanin content, abnormal chloroplasts, reduced photosynthetic capacity. Severely reduced lamellae lipid membranes in the plastids. The mutant plants have retarded growth phenotypes. The plastids of the mutant line had fewer stromal thylakoids, no grana, less starch grains and more densely stained, globular structures that likely represent plastoglobuli. Moreover, the resultant defects in chloroplast integrity undoubtedly lead to a dramatic decrease in the photosynthetic capacity, which consequently results in smaller plants and lower seed number. At the same time, abnormal chloroplasts and reduced photosynthetic capacity may create a nutritional stress response, which is marked by a significant increase in the anthocyanin levels. This finding is consistent with the observations that anthocyanins are induced by a number of environmental stresses. Suppresses elongation and gravicurviture in light grown hypocotyls.

Inhibition of root elongation is substantially less sensitive to cytokinin  than the wild type plants and is less responsive to cytokinin over the whole range of cytokinin benzyl adenine (BA) concentrations used in the growth media. Reduced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in response to cytokinin, consistent with reduced sensitivity to the hormone. very short and narrow primary root. xylem development in the narrow primary root is less extensive than in the larger primary root of wild-type plants.

About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature. . Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype. . bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems had a decreased ratio of adaxialized vascular phenotypes compared with kan1 kan2 stems. Similar to what was observed in petioles, 6.7% of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems exhibited an abaxialized phenotype of xylem surrounded by phloem, while others (13.3%) had both types of vasculature in a single stem. Similar to kan1 kan2 double mutant.  However, the ovules have a novel phenotype, forming a single amorphous structure in place of both integuments. All kan1 kan2 stem vascular bundles displayed phloem surrounded by xylem, indicating adaxialized polarity. Cotyledons are narrow, cup-shaped and point upward. Leaves are narrow, dark green and develop ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial side only.  Four to six stipules, rather than two, develop at the base of each leaf, surrounding its entire circumference.  Stems fail to elongate upon flowering.  Floral organ morphology is highly abnormal.  Mature ovules have reduced outer integuments. Aberrant positioning of cell types, primarily along the adaxial/abaxial lateral organ axis. Double mutant plants have narrow leaves and developed ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina. . External structures of the carpel are largely absent.  Ovules arise from a surface or column of tissue at the center of the flower. The inner integuments of these ovules are normal but the asymmetrical outer integument is now a nearly symmetrical and relatively amorphous collar of tissue. The vasculature in more than half (55.9%) of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles exhibited a pattern of phloem surrounded by xylem, representing an adaxialized phenotype. However, very surprisingly, 17.6% of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles had abaxialized vasculature or a mixture of adaxialized and abaxialized vasculature. Radialized leaf like organs form on the hypocotyl.

The ultrastructure of the plastids is conspicuously different to wild type plastids. Most evident is the structure of the thylakoids, which are reduced and the grana are unorganized compared to the wild type situation. The overall architecture of mutant homozygous plants is slightly altered compared to wild type. Roots of 6 day-old seedlings were 35% shorter on average. The main macroscopic effect of the mutation is that mutant plants produce a large amount of aborted seeds. Only about 60% of the mature seeds contain phenotypically normal, viable embryos. Up to 30% of the seeds are aborted, dark and shrunken, and do not germinate. Most of these aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the globular stage as well as ball/oblong-shaped embryos (ca. 75%). The morphogenesis of these embryos was blocked before initiation of cotyledon growth and establishment of bilateral symmetry. The other aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the torpedo or bent cotyledon stage with abnormal- shaped, thickened hypocotyls and underdeveloped cotyledons (ca. 25%).

However, stomata cells appeared normal in terms of morphology and fraction of total epidermal cells. Leaves, stems and sepals were lighter green than WT plants throughout the life cycle. Pigment content analyses demonstrated that mutant rosette leaves contained less chlorophyll and anthocyanin compared to WT. . Mutant had fewer rosette leaves compared to WT plants at the same age. Moreover, mutant rosette leaves were smaller and more round and had shorter petioles than WT. . Mutant hypocotyls were 75% of the length of WT hypocotyls when grown under long-day conditions, which corresponded to a reduction in hypocotyl cell length but not cell number. However, hypocotyl length was not compromised when mutant seedlings were grown in the dark. The mutant had shorter, more slender  inflorescence stems with fewer auxillary branches and side bolts. Mutant produced fewer flowers than WT and had fewer and shorter siliques, fewer seeds per silique and a higher percentage of sterile siliques, resulting in less seed production. More than half of the mutant flowers were fertile, and although they were smaller than WT flowers, they opened normally and had normal arrangements and numbers of floral organs. Some sterile flowers were open, while others remained closed. One reason for sterility was the failure of the stamens to elongate beyond the pistil at floral stage 14, whereas, in WT, the stamens were longer than the pistil and brushed against the stigma to allow pollination and fertilization. Whereas, as plants matured, WT rosette leaves curled down, mutant leaves remained flat.		TAIR

T-DNA knock-out mutants of PHO1.H1 neither showed growth defects nor alteration in phosphate (Pi) transport dynamics, or Pi content, compared with wild type. Vegetative growth of the mutant appears to be comparable with wild type for plants grown in soil, although the mutant has flowers with smaller petals and reduced fertility.  The abnormal flower phenotype has been reported to occur in a fraction of the transgenic plants derived from the Madison collection, and is thought to be linked to the presence of an AP1 sequence in the T-DNA.

At 21°C, there was no significant difference between the double mutant and wild type. however, at 26°C, there was significantly less free IAA in cyp79B2 cyp79B3 relative to Col-0. In addition, the cyp79B3 mutant showed a modest decrease in free IAA compared with Col-0 at 26°C. Following <i>P. syringae</i> infection,  camalexin in the double mutant was undetectable. Similar results were observed following <i>A. brassicicola</i> infection. Indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) treatment restored camalexin synthesis in cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plants that are unable to produce camalexin due to failure to synthesize indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx). The double mutant was as susceptible to <i>A. brassicicola</i> as pad3-1 and cyp71A13 mutants. . The hypocotyl length of the double mutant grown at 26°C was ~50% of the length of the wild type grown under the same conditions. This reduction in hypocotyl length likely correlates with decreased levels of endogenous-free IAA. Adult cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plants are also sensitive to temperature changes. cyp79B2 cyp79B3 grown at 19°C has much smaller, slightly curled leaves that are characteristic of known IAA-resistant mutants. .

However, their overall size can exceed that of wild type plants if they receive adequate water. The transcript profile of these mutants differs from wild type under normal conditions, and in response to dehydration stress. Levels of numerous stress-inducible transcripts are increased in the double mutant. In addition, the double mutants appear to be more tolerant to dehydration stress than wild type plants, based on ion leakage assays and recovery after dehydration stress experiments. There are no obvious morphological defects in the drip2-1 mutant, but the drip1-1 drip 2-1 double mutant has altered gene expression levels and dehydration tolerance.		TAIR

These seedlings developed short, slow growing roots compared with wild-type roots, and were arrested at the late seedling stage. Plants with the genotype AXL/axl-1 axr1-12/axr1-12 had a slight but consistent reduction in RUB-CUL1 levels. . The axr1-12/axr1-12 AXL/axl-1 line are nearly completely resistant to auxin, a much more severe phenotype than for axr1-12 alone. The columella of AXL/axl-1 axr1-12/axr1-12 root tips is highly disorganized during early seedling root growth, and is completely disrupted at the time when root growth ceases. No visible phenotype. Mutant has a normal level of RUB-CUL1 that is in keeping with the lack of any growth defect in these plants. No defect in meristem organization. No embryo defects were found. Double homozygous mutant seedlings are completely deficient in RUB-modified CUL1. Double homozygous progeny has severe growth and developmental defects. The phenotype of these plants resembled the bdl/iaa12 and mp/arf5 mutants. These seedlings did not segregate at the expected 1/16 ratio. Instead, we identified three double mutant seedlings in 176 F2 plants, suggesting the homozygous double mutants are arrested during embryogenesis. .

5060	ath	AT3G01650		No visible phenotype. The triple mutant had an approximately additive phenotype. They were bushy and displayed the reduced fertility of axr1-12 plants. Although the overall growth of young rglg1 rglg2 seedlings closely resembled that of wild-type plants, the early rosette leaves were more elongated and darker. These early rosette leaves senesce after ~4 to 6 weeks of growth. The first emerging shoots were short and terminated by one or few flowers yielding fertile siliques. Later developing shoots were longer. Another difference between the wild type and the rglg1 rglg2 mutant was leaf shape and architecture. Mutant leaves were more oblong and often asymmetric and had reduced numbers of veins. Whereas leaf initials in the wild type formed a spiral, with an ~137.5° angle between leaf initials, the rglg1 rglg2 mutant formed two initials opposite to each other and then switched by 90° to form the next pair of opposing leaves. Thus, rglg1 rglg2 plants often had a decussate pattern of leaf mergence, instead of the spiral pattern of wild-type Arabidopsis. Additional phenotypes of aerial plant parts, in particular an increased cell size. . Auxin (IAA) concentration was almost twofold lower in roots of 2-week-old mutant seedlings compared to wild type. . Changes in the concentrations of cytokinin nucleotides and conjugates. Impaired circadian clock function. Roots of wild-type and mutant plants were similar in spite of a moderate (14%) reduction in the main root length of plantlets grown on plates. The double mutant showed a complete loss of apical dominance, lacking normal dominance of the central apical meristem, and the development of a central inflorescence. All double mutants grown to maturity had >30 shoots of comparable length. Showed some phenotypic similarity with tir3-1 axr1-12 plants, being more bushy than tir3-1 plants and often producing siliques in bundles. .

Eventually flowers resembling those of ap1 single mutants eventually appear and set seeds. Early flower mutant phenotypes are lessened in later-arising flowers which appear more normal whilst still displaying significant perturbations of organ development. Gynoecium  often supported by an elongated gynophore. Many flowers display a loss of fourth whorl determinancy. Profound changes in early arising flowers. Both organ numbers and organ identity are affected in a highly variable manner. Stellate trichomes are frequently observed on carpels (never on wild-type). Adaxial epidermal cells have a slightly irregular edge, indicating a partial adoption of leaf fate. All flower organs resemble sepals. The second whorl has four green sepal-like organs (instead of four white petals) which are differentiated of interspersed stomata and the conversion of nearly all of the cells into sepal cells. Sepals replace stamens in the third whorl. The fourth whorl is a reiteration of whorls 1, 2 and 3. All flower organs are converted to leaf-like organs, most strikingly on their adaxial surface. Abaxial epidermal cells are made up of a mixture of leaf- and sepal-like characteristics. Leaf characteristics include an abundance of branched trichomes. Normal flowers apart from a reduction in the number of stamens. Adaxial surface of first whorl organs are unaffected. Non-described subtle phenotype.		TAIR

5495	ath	AT4G14220		The rhf1a mutant does not have any visibly aberrant phenotypes, but, an rhf1a rhf2a double mutant reveals the role of these two proteins in gametogenesis and proteolysis. This double mutant has shorter siliques than WT plants, and lower fertility. Approximately 60% of ovules abort the megagametophytic development process at the FG1 stage. Often, one of the megaspores that is supposed to degenerate remains visible in the rhf1a rhf2a megagametophyte for a prolonged period of time. Some of the mutants arrested at the two nucleate (F2) stage, whereas about 30% developed normal female gametophytes that could be successfully fertilized to produce viable seed. The pollen of the double mutant is largely defective with about 50-70% nonviability compared to ~0.5% nonviability for wild type pollen. The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2. Levels of myc:KRP6 increase in the double mutant, suggesting that this protein is a putative substrate of this E3 ubiquitin ligase. And many of the aberrant phenotypes observed in the double mutant can be improved when KRP6 levels are decreased by RNAi.		TAIR

Increased susceptibility to Trichoplusia ni larvae attack, associated with a lack of larvae-induced JA accumulation. No change in susceptibility or JA accumulation upon Alternaria brassicicola infection when compared with the wild-type. Reduced fecundity most likely due to decreased pollen viability. severely impaired in jasmonate biosynthesis, produced fewer seed-containing siliques and fewer viable seeds. JA level did not increase significantly in response to wounding, more susceptible to the leaf-chewing insect Trichoplusia ni. A sucrose-independent germination phenotype. Mutants have reduced medium- and long-chain Acyl-CoA enzyme activity. Lipid catabolism during germination and early post-germinative growth was unaltered in the acx1-1 mutant. seedling growth and establishment in the absence of an exogenous supply of sucrose was unaffected. Jasmonic acid accumulation was largely reduced upon wounding of mutant plants when compared to the wild type. Double mutant seedlings were unable to catabolize seed storage lipids and accumulated long-chain acyl-CoAs. The acx1-1 acx2-1 seedlings were also unable to establish photosynthetic competency in the absence of an exogenous carbon supply, a phenotype that is shared with a number of other Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in storage lipid breakdown. Germination frequency of the double mutant was significantly reduced compared with wild-type seeds. This was unaffected by the addition of exogenous sucrose, but was improved by dormancy-breaking treatments such as cold stratification and after-ripening.  Peroxisomes in the cotyledons were enlarged in double mutants, while in single mutants (acx1-1 and acx2-1) peroxisomes were identical to the wild type. Plants display decreased sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) on root elongation, while remaining sensitive to inhibitory concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid.  They maintain their ability to initiate lateral roots in response to IBA.		TAIR

This mutant does not have any obvious morphological defects and it responds normally to ACC and IAA. These triple mutants do not make a primary root, they have an extremely reduced hypocotyl, and they lack discernible vasculature in their cotyledons. These mutants have a higher propensity to develop a single cotyledon than wild-type embryos. The roots of this mutant show almost no sensitivity to the ethylene precursor ACC, but sensitivity is largely restored by the addition of low levels of IAA (but not tryptophan). ACC-triggered dark-grown apical hook formation is also compromised in this mutant, and it is not restored by the addition of IAA. Root gravitropism is more disrupted in this double mutant than in either single mutant. The mutant plants are shorter than wild type, have reduced venation in their leaves, exhibit reduced apical dominance, and produce abnormal flowers. DR5:GUS expression is also diminished in these double mutants, consistent with a ~50% reduction in IAA levels in these mutants.

Similar results were observed following <i>A. brassicicola</i> infection. Subtle growth phenotypes under normal culture conditions: double mutant plants have slightly shorter petioles and smaller leaves, which would be expected if the double mutant produces less IAA. At 21°C, there was no significant difference between the double mutant and wild type. however, at 26°C, there was significantly less free IAA in cyp79B2 cyp79B3 relative to Col-0. In addition, the cyp79B3 mutant showed a modest decrease in free IAA compared with Col-0 at 26°C. Following <i>P. syringae</i> infection,  camalexin in the double mutant was undetectable. Similar results were observed following <i>A. brassicicola</i> infection. Indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) treatment restored camalexin synthesis in cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plants that are unable to produce camalexin due to failure to synthesize indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx). The double mutant was as susceptible to <i>A. brassicicola</i> as pad3-1 and cyp71A13 mutants. . The hypocotyl length of the double mutant grown at 26°C was ~50% of the length of the wild type grown under the same conditions. This reduction in hypocotyl length likely correlates with decreased levels of endogenous-free IAA. Adult cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plants are also sensitive to temperature changes. cyp79B2 cyp79B3 grown at 19°C has much smaller, slightly curled leaves that are characteristic of known IAA-resistant mutants. . Wild-type plants were minimally sensitive to 5 &#956.M 5-methyltryptophan (5MT), whereas the double mutant was extremely sensitive to this concentration of 5MT and appears at least threefold more sensitive to 5MT than to wild type.

Although the overall growth of young rglg1 rglg2 seedlings closely resembled that of wild-type plants, the early rosette leaves were more elongated and darker. These early rosette leaves senesce after ~4 to 6 weeks of growth. The first emerging shoots were short and terminated by one or few flowers yielding fertile siliques. Later developing shoots were longer. Another difference between the wild type and the rglg1 rglg2 mutant was leaf shape and architecture. Mutant leaves were more oblong and often asymmetric and had reduced numbers of veins. Whereas leaf initials in the wild type formed a spiral, with an ~137.5° angle between leaf initials, the rglg1 rglg2 mutant formed two initials opposite to each other and then switched by 90° to form the next pair of opposing leaves. Thus, rglg1 rglg2 plants often had a decussate pattern of leaf mergence, instead of the spiral pattern of wild-type Arabidopsis. Additional phenotypes of aerial plant parts, in particular an increased cell size. . Auxin (IAA) concentration was almost twofold lower in roots of 2-week-old mutant seedlings compared to wild type. . Changes in the concentrations of cytokinin nucleotides and conjugates. Impaired circadian clock function. Roots of wild-type and mutant plants were similar in spite of a moderate (14%) reduction in the main root length of plantlets grown on plates. The double mutant showed a complete loss of apical dominance, lacking normal dominance of the central apical meristem, and the development of a central inflorescence. All double mutants grown to maturity had >30 shoots of comparable length. Showed some phenotypic similarity with tir3-1 axr1-12 plants, being more bushy than tir3-1 plants and often producing siliques in bundles. . The triple homozygous progeny has low viability, accumulated anthocyanin, and all plants died before shoot emergence.		TAIR

Eventually flowers resembling those of ap1 single mutants eventually appear and set seeds. Non-described subtle phenotype. Early flower mutant phenotypes are lessened in later-arising flowers which appear more normal whilst still displaying significant perturbations of organ development. Gynoecium  often supported by an elongated gynophore. Many flowers display a loss of fourth whorl determinancy. Profound changes in early arising flowers. Both organ numbers and organ identity are affected in a highly variable manner. Stellate trichomes are frequently observed on carpels (never on wild-type). Adaxial epidermal cells have a slightly irregular edge, indicating a partial adoption of leaf fate. All flower organs resemble sepals. The second whorl has four green sepal-like organs (instead of four white petals) which are differentiated of interspersed stomata and the conversion of nearly all of the cells into sepal cells. Sepals replace stamens in the third whorl. The fourth whorl is a reiteration of whorls 1, 2 and 3. All flower organs are converted to leaf-like organs, most strikingly on their adaxial surface. Abaxial epidermal cells are made up of a mixture of leaf- and sepal-like characteristics. Leaf characteristics include an abundance of branched trichomes.

5824	ath	AT5G16850		AtTERT deficiency leads to telomere shortening and absence of telomerase activity. During five generations of growth, both tert and atm/tert lose about 500 bp of chromosome length per generation. But, whereas tert mutants show no visible growth defects through the G6 generation, atm/tert mutants in G5 show severe growth defects, such as aberrant leaf shape, delayed flowering, a loss of apical dominance, and reduced fertility. atm/tert mutants in G5 have a much higher rate of bridged chromosomes than G5 tert mutants. atm tert mutants undergo Telomere Rapid Deletion (TRD) events, that can lead to the production of a chromosome with a very short telomere. Just one of these structures can  prompt end-to-end chromosomal fusion events in the G5 generation. The anaphase bridges apparent in these atm/tert mutants seem to involve only a single chromosome in each distinct mutant line, and seem to occur between sister chromatids. These plants exhibit the same overall level of aneuploidy in the G5 generation as tert mutants do in the G6 generation (~52% of cells showing abnormal centromeric signals in interphase). atm/tert mutants are not as likely to undergo ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent process) as tert mutants, implicating ATM in this process. atr/tert mutants show a more rapid loss of telomeric length than tert and atm/tert mutants, and show a more rapid degeneration in growth habit, becoming small, with aberrant leaf shape, and very low fertility by the third generation whereas tert mutants and tert/atm mutants show normal growth features until later generations. These mutants also have marked defects in chromosomal organization by G3 as evidenced by the presence of anaphase bridges, sometimes involving multiple chromosomes, a phenotype not seen in tert or atm/tert mutants. In contrast to the ku70 mutant, which undergo telomerase-dependent expansion to more than twice the normal length in a single generation, the ku70 tert double mutant displays accelerated telomere shortening and a precocious onset of genome stability. . Same degree of telomere shortening as in the pot1 ku70 and ku70 tert double mutants. Telomeres in the double mutants shortened at the same rate as in either single mutant. . Telomeres of the same length and sharp banding profile were found in the double mutant, as in their tert and pot1-1 siblings. 50% of the mitotic nuclei in anaphase from tert mutants with severe growth defects (in the G8 generation) have anaphase bridges, while none are found in comparable wild type controls. These anaphase bridges occur disproportionately often between rDNA regions. A number of chromosomal defects can also be visualized during metaphase in these mutants. About 30% of the leaf mesophyll cells examined in tert G8 mutants have elevated numbers of nucleoli. Late generation, starting around G3,  tert mutants have decreased root meristem size and overall root length. This is correlated with decreased telomere length in successive generations suggesting maintenance of meristem activity is coupled to telomere length. No obvious phenotypic changes in the first (G1) or second (G2) generation. However, starting in G1, the telomeric smear in AtTERT-deficient plants was replaced by several sharp bands. By G2 at least 11 discrete telomeric fragments were visible. . tert-2 mutants in the G4 generation exhibit shorter chromosomes, but also form more massive calluses, indicative of an accelerated cell cycle. These calluses also die more quickly than calluses from wild type plants.		TAIR

This double mutant has shorter siliques than WT plants, and lower fertility. Approximately 60% of ovules abort the megagametophytic development process at the FG1 stage. Often, one of the megaspores that is supposed to degenerate remains visible in the rhf1a rhf2a megagametophyte for a prolonged period of time. Some of the mutants arrested at the two nucleate (F2) stage, whereas about 30% developed normal female gametophytes that could be successfully fertilized to produce viable seed. The pollen of the double mutant is largely defective with about 50-70% nonviability compared to ~0.5% nonviability for wild type pollen. The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2. Levels of myc:KRP6 increase in the double mutant, suggesting that this protein is a putative substrate of this E3 ubiquitin ligase.

Chilling of seedlings at 4°C for 1 month effectively induces flowering of ga1-3 without GA treatment. However, no bolting of the stem or flowering of the triple homozygous progeny could be detected even after 40 days of cold treatment. The triple homozygous progeny does not germinate when untreated. However, when the seed coat of ungerminated seeds is removed under an optical microscope, the treated seeds germinate under continuous light for  3 days on an MS plate, and develop into seedlings. The triple homozygous progeny is insensitive to GA. The triple homozygous progeny showed very severe dwarfism, whereas the parental plants (Aabbcc) showed a weak phenotype. No visible phenotype. Complete infertility. Defect in floral organ morphology.: dramatic reduction in length of pistil, stamen and petal development arrested, and striking reduction in the elongation of the pedicel. Delayed flowering. Dramatic reduction in rosette radius and root length compared to wild type (87 and 74% reduction, respectively). Dwarf phenotype. Elevated gibberellin levels. Increased levels of RGA protein. Unresponsive to GA treatment. Partial suppression of the gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-1 triple mutant phenotype. Dwarf phenotype recognizable at a young seedling stage.

Slightly increased leaf serration during vegetative development. increased number of sepals and petals during reproductive development. irregular flower arrangement due to repressed cell division in the internodes that separate individual flowers. No visible phenotype. Flowers have more petals than the wild-type, particularly in the first 10 flowers.  Four petal primordia are initiated in the same positions as in wild-type.  The extra petals, if initiated, always arise adjacent to these normally positioned petals.  Occasionally, petals form incisions at their distal tip and adopt a heart shape.  There is also a subtle carpel fusion defect at the distal end of the gynoecium in a small portion of mutant flowers.  The organ-number defect is petal specific.  In mutant plants, the transcript levels of the transcription factors CUC1 and CUC2 are significantly increased compared to wild-type.  Overall expression domains of CUC1 and CUC2 appear to be normal.  However, during floral stages 5-7, extra CUC1- and CUC2-expressing cells are observed in the second whorl. Plants appear normal during vegetative growth. Phenotypic alterations start after the switch to reproductive development. Flowers have an increased number of sepals and petals. Floral organ numbers are highly variable. Individual organs varied in size. Carpels failed to fuse resulting in severe reduction of fertility. In addition, plants display a highly unequal and distorted arrangement of flowers, both with respect to the angle formed by two consecutive flowers and their distance from each other along the axis of the stem.

However, morphology and fertility of the flowers is relatively unaffected. Compact rosettes with shortened petioles and small leaf blades. Root elongation unaffected. Semi-dwarf phenotype. The hypocotyl length of the double mutant is slightly decreased. this effect is largely due to reduction in cell number rather than cell size.

Displays secondary lateral root branching (not seen in wild-type). Downwards bending of cotyledons indicating differential growth in the adaxial and abaxial sides. Enhancement of phenotype observed for single mutant ahk3-7: Reduced ability to respond to cytokinin by callus or shoot formation. Enhancement of phenotype observed in single mutant ahk3-7: Mutant seedlings grow better and form darker green leaves in the presence of elevated levels of cytokinins in medium.

Total loss of cytokinin-dependent chlorophyll retention in leaves (under dark conditions causing the so-called 'dark-induced senescence'). Two- to three-fold increase of concentrations of all zeatin metabolites. Almost completely infertile but can be allowed to self-fertilize under favorable temperature and light conditions. Chlorophyll content about 35% of that of wild-type. Delay in flowering induction. Delay in rate of leaf formation. Longer plastochrone. Increase in trans-zeatin (16-fold) and trans-zeatin ribosides (9-fold) concentrations. 50-fold concentration increase for zeatin-O-glucoside. Increased cytokinin resistance compared to double mutant ahk2-5 ahk3-7. Increased seed size, largely due to increased size of the embryo. Embryonic root epidermal cells increased 15% in number and 30% in size compared to wild-type. Leaf epifermal cell size is increased about three-fold compared to wild-type cells, in young as well as older leaves. Shorter hypocotyls than wild-type when grown in white light but increase in length when grown in darkness (~25%) and red- and far-red-light. Stronger reduction of shoot development compared to double mutant ahk2-5 ahk3-7. With a few exceptions, no increase in zeatin concentrations.

Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. Reduced shoot meristem size. Plants arrest early in development due to loss of shoot apical meristem but recover through adventitious shoot formation. Reduced numbers of stamens and carpels suggesting a reduction in floral meristem size. Triple mutant enhances the floral meristem defects of clv1-11 single mutant. Novel phenotypes include the existence of an enlarged indeterminate meristem in the center of each flower. Leaves are smaller and number of rosette leaves is increased. Number of carpels not statistically significant form that of clv2-1 alone. Triple mutant shows greater suppression of the clv3-2 with approximately 4.3 carpels per flower compared to clv3-2 single mutants which have approximately 6.7 carpels per flower.

Petals have abnormal proximal-distal organization. Flowers and siliques bend downwards and pedicels are reduced in length.  The inflorescence is more compact with respect to wild type due to a reduction in internode length.  Overall plant height is approximately half that of a wild type Ws-3 plant. Change in lignin deposition in the mutant.  Deposition begins much earlier in the mutant and an irregular pattern of lignin accumulation results in gaps in the lignin ring.		TAIR
6114	ath	AT5G67060		Shows no alteration in fruit phenotype. The transmitting tract of hec1 was  indistinguishable from that of wild type in size, staining intensity (Alcian Blue) and cytology. Compared with wild type, stigmas were smaller and more variable in size in hec1 hec3 mutants. There was also a slight tendency for the style to be somewhat longer in the double mutant. Double mutant had a sizable reduction in overall fertility (17% wild-type seed set), along with significant variations in individual fruit size and seed yield. Seed distribution was biased toward the apical half of the carpel, but substantial fertilization also occurred in the basal half. Mutant carpels showed significantly fewer pollen tubes and pollination events, particularly in the basal half of the gynoecium. The double mutant, however, had dramatically reduced Alcian Blue staining in both the style and the septum compared with wild type. In analyzing pre-fertilization stages of development, the transmitting tract of the hec1 hec3 double mutant had no delay in onset of ECM production, but produced less ECM than wild type. The hec1,2,3 spt quadruple mutant had an enhanced phenotype compared to the hec1,2,3 triple or spt single.
