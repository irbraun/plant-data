3	mtr	Medtr3g021350|cyp716A12|Medtr3g021180	lha	Impaired hemolytic saponin synthesis. Plant growth stunted. A cytochrome P450 gene (CYP716A12) is involved in an early step in saponin biosynthesis and is found in most tissues.  CYP716A12 loss-of-function mutants do not produce hemolytic saponins and only synthetize soyasaponins, and were thus named lacking hemolytic activity (lha).  CYP716A12 catalyzes the oxidation of _-amyrin and erythrodiol at the C-28 position, yielding oleanolic acid. Transcriptome changes in the lha mutant showed a modulation in the main steps of the triterpenic saponin biosynthetic pathway, which includes squalene cyclization, _-amyrin oxidation, and glycosylation.  Growth of homozygous lha/lha plants was stunted.	GO:0016135|PATO:0001236|PATO:0000460|PO:0000003|PATO:0000587	Plant PhenomeNET

Mutant floret has 3 ovaries. female fertile. a mutant floret has degenerated lemma and palea, so that they fail to enclose the stamens and pistil. The mutant does not produce normal stamens and is thus male sterile. Usually, one floret forms one caryopsis. Although mutant is male sterile, it can produce seeds when pollinated with pollen from wild type plants. In that case one or two naked seeds can be formed in a single floret. So, the mutant is female fertile. In general, a mutant floret contains many pistils but no stamens, indicating that the stamens are transformed to pistils. In some mutant florets, pistilloid stamens containing a filament tipped by malformed tissue and deformed stigma or one to three stigmas were observed. In the cross section of a wild type floret six filaments representing the six stamens and an ovary representing the pistil in the middle can be seen clearly, while in a mutant floret, some filaments and some pistilloid tissues, e.g., the ovary-like or malformed tissues are observed. The pistilloid tissues are counterparts of the wild type stamens. In the longitudinal section of a mutant floret, three ovaries can be seen clearly. .

Stomatal distribution is  affected in cotyledons. plants have fewer stomata than wild-type plants, and the stomata are frequently larger than those of wild-type plants. Trichomes of the first rosette leaves are strongly deformed.

The gynoecia of double mutants showed severe reduction of the ovary and morphological abnormalities in the apical region that were similar  to ett strong allele mutant phenotypes. Occasionally, inflorescences of the double mutant failed to produce any normal flower buds, resulting in pin-like structures that were not found in either stv1 or ett single mutants. Pin-like inflorescences are formed in mp, pid, and pin1 mutants and in wild-type plants treated with polar auxin transport inhibitors. The gynoecial defects of ett-1 mutants, such as reduction in ovary size and increased gynophore elongation, were enhanced by the sty1-1 mutation. A number of double mutant gynoecia were nearly completely valveless, and in those, ovules grew on top of a placental surface. In addition, the apical ends of sty1-1 ett-1 gynoecia were less fused than those of ett-1 and sty1-1, and ovules frequently protruded at the apex. The amount of stylar and stigmatic tissues was reduced compared with ett-1, and the double mutant was sterile.

69	ath	At5g06070|RBE|AT5G06070		Abnormal petal morphology.  Altered petal morphology. A wild-type flower has four petals of almost the same size and shape. A petal is flat from top to bottom, and the bottom part is narrow and greenish. In rbe-1, petals were deformed and their degree of morphological abnormality varied from a mild phenotype of a reduced blade at the top, an intermediate phenotype of spoon-shaped petals with a small blade and a short filamentous stalk at the base, to a severe phenotype of filaments only. In some cases, no petals or filaments were observed at the position of petal formation. . The epidermal cells on the lower surface of the filaments of rbe-1 had an irregular ridged structure similar to that of the lower surface of the wild type, but the cells were flattened and elliptic. The position of the filamentous petals was normal. that is, they were formed in the second whorl at a position between the medial and lateral sepals. Furthermore, in the small or spoon-shaped petals of rbe-1, the epidermal cells had a ridged structure and were smaller . This suggests that the position and identity of the aberrant-shaped petals of rbe was not altered. . Defective in petal development. petals are transformed to filamentous organs, or lost. ovules have shorter integuments than those of wild type, producing shorter siliques. reduced fertility. strong allele. Defective in sepal, petal, and ovule development. flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals. petals are often reduced in size or altered  in appearance, petals often absent or replaced by staminoid organs and filaments. altered integument growth in ovules. reduced fertility. During stage 3 of flower development, four sepal primordia are initiated in normal positions in rbe-3 mutants. However, early in stage 4 some rbe-3 sepal primordia have undergone extra growth along their margins and appear wider than normal. The tips of these primordia were sometimes not located in the middle of the primordia and the two sides of the primordia were not symmetrical. Continued uneven growth of these primordia became more pronounced during development. By stage 5, an organ that had presumably initiated as a single primordium now appeared as two fused primordia or two closely spaced and partially fused primordia. . In rbe-3 flowers, second-whorl petals are often reduced in size or altered in appearance. Petals with staminoid characteristics, stamens, filaments or the absence of organs can all be found in the second whorl of rbe-3 mutants. Mutant flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals. More than four sepals were observed in approximately 7% of rbe-3 flowers, while some degree of sepal fusion was observed in 35% of flowers (corresponding to 10% of all sepals). In rbe-3 flowers with more than four sepals, the extra sepal was thinner than the remaining four sepals. In some cases, one of the adjacent sepals was  also somewhat reduced in width. Sepal fusion can occur in the absence of more than four sepals. Sepal fusion was observed most often at the base of these organs and more rarely along their entire length. We measured the width of mature sepals to determine whether  sepal fusion might be due to wider organs. rbe-3 sepals were 12% wider than Landsberg erecta (Ler) sepals at maturity. Same phenotype as ag-1 single mutants with completely normal petals developing in the second whorl. In addition, sepal number was normal in these flowers and no cases of sepal fusion were observed. Double mutants had an increased number of sepals compared with either single mutant. In early arising flowers as many as eight sepals were present. In addition, fusion between sepals was observed in ant-4 rbe-3 mutants. Sepals in the double mutant were often fused along their entire length rather than just at their base as usually seen in rbe-3. . Mutant flowers also show a reduction in the overall number of second-whorl organs. In addition, fewer filaments and staminoid organs were present in the double mutant compared with rbe-3 single mutants. Reduced stamen number in the third whorl of ant-4 mutants was partially rescued by rbe-3. Additive phenotype in the first and fourth whorls. Second-whorl organs of the double mutant were more completely converted to stamens or were missing entirely. . The enhancement of the second-whorl phenotypes in these double mutants resulted from AG misexpression. In the double mutants, first-whorl carpels and staminoid carpels were often wider than in ap2-2. These organs had the appearance of several fused organs but were only connected to the base of the flower in the central part of the organ and were in a position normally occupied by a single organ. In addition, first-whorl organs were often fused along much of their length. All of the first-whorl organs were sometimes fused such that the fourth whorl carpel poked through a ring of tissue. Cells present along the margin of fusion resembled the epidermal cells normally present on the abaxial replum of wild-type carpels. . The number of first whorl organs in the double mutant was slightly increased compared with ap2-2 single mutants. No second-whorl organs were present in the double mutant and the third and fourth whorls had an additive phenotype. leaf curling similar to that in clf-2. Both clf-2 and clf-2 rbe-3 produced an average of 4.0 second-whorl organs per flower. In clf-2 mutants these were almost exclusively small petals whereas the average number of small petals in clf-2 rbe-3 was 1.37. Second-whorl petals were most often replaced by spoonshaped petals, staminoid petals, petaloid stamens or stamens. . Four distinct sepal primordia are initiated in a normal pattern during stage 3 of flower development as was seen previously for cuc2-1 and rbe-3 single mutants. Later growth of sepal primordia in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double is uneven, similar to that seen in rbe-3 single mutants. An increased extent of sepal fusion in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double mutant as compared with cuc2-1 was first observed during stage 6. In double mutant flowers, sepal fusion occurred more often and to a greater extent than in either single mutant. . Additive phenotype. The number of second-whorl organs was reduced in lug-1 rbe-3 double mutants and these remaining organs were primarily staminoid. Thus, rbe-3 enhanced the second-whorl phenotype of lug-1 mutants. The double mutant rarely produced any seeds, suggesting a more severe defect in female fertility in the double mutant compared with either single mutant. However, no enhancement of the outer integument growth defect was observed. Double-mutant flowers have a phenotype that is similar to ufo-11 flowers. Double mutant has the same phenotype as the ufo-2 single mutant. There is no increase in the number of filaments and/or staminoid organs in the double mutant as compared with ufo-2.
